Captain's Log, Stardate 46041.1. We have located the USS Yosemite, a
Starfleet science vessel sent to the Igo sector to observe a remote
plasma streamer. The ship has not been heard from in several days.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Magnify. <br>
(the ship is inside the pink plasma streamer) <br>
RIKER: The last report we have says they were observing the streamer at
medium range. Maybe they went in for a closer look, got more than they
bargained for. <br>
PICARD: Hail them. <br>
WORF: No response. <br>
PICARD: Life signs? <br>
DATA: Our scanners cannot penetrate the plasma streamer's distortion
field. <br>
PICARD: Can we tractor them out? <br>
DATA: No, sir. Ionic interference is too heavy. <br>
RIKER: I'll take a shuttle in. <br>
PICARD: Too risky. You could be pulled in too. Bridge to Engineering. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD [OC]: Mister La Forge, can we beam an away
team onto the science ship?
<br>LAFORGE: We can beam them over there, Captain, but with all this
interference, we might not get a positive lock to bring them back. <br>
BARCLAY: Commander, if we bridged our transporter system with theirs we
might be able to cut through the ionic field. <br>
LAFORGE: That's a good idea, Barclay. Captain, I think we can do it.
We're going to bridge the two transporter systems. <br>
PICARD [OC]: Acknowledged. Meet Commander Riker in Transporter room
three. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye sir. Barclay, I'm going to need a systems engineer on this
Away Team. <br>
BARCLAY: I'll ask Ensign Dern to join you. <br>
LAFORGE: I meant you, Barclay. <br>
BARCLAY: Shouldn't I stay here and set up the remote link? <br>
LAFORGE: Dern can do that. Come on, let's go.

O'BRIEN: I'll have to send you over one at a time, Commander, because
of band width limitations, and the transport cycle will take a little
longer. <br>
RIKER: How much longer? <br>
O'BRIEN: Four, five seconds. About twice the normal time. I'm afraid
you're in for a bumpy ride, Commander.<br>
BARCLAY: What do you? What exactly do you mean by a bumpy ride? <br>
O'BRIEN: There may be a small amount of static charge accumulation.
You'll feel a bit of tingling. It's nothing to worry about. <br>
RIKER: Let's do it. Mister Worf. <br>
(Worf gets onto the pad) <br>
O'BRIEN: Engaging system interlock. Pattern buffers synchronised. Phase
transition coils at stand by. Energising. He's there. <br>

reading an ionic fluctuation in the matter stream. Oh, no problem.
Okay. Energising. <br>
LAFORGE: Reg, you're up. Reg. <br>
BARCLAY: Aye, sir. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Barclay is pacing, upset) <br>
TROI: Reg, you were faced with a difficult transport. Anyone would have
been apprehensive in that situation. <br>
BARCLAY: Tell that to Commander La Forge and the rest of the away team.
<br>
TROI: I'm sure they understand. As soon as you feel up to it, you can
probably still join them. <br>
BARCLAY: No! <br>
TROI: Reg, is there something you're not telling me? <br>
BARCLAY: Actually, this isn't the first time I've been apprehensive.
Every single time that I tried to do it, I had a certain feeling. I
guess you could call it mortal terror. <br>
TROI: Why have you kept it a secret? <br>
BARCLAY: Why? Because my career in Starfleet would be over, that's why.
<br>
TROI: I doubt that. <br>
BARCLAY: I've always managed to avoid it somehow. You wouldn't believe
how many hours that I've logged in shuttlecraft. I mean, The idea of
being deconstructed, molecule by molecule. It's more than I can stand.
Even when I was a child, I always had a dreadful fear that if ever I
was dematerialised that I would never come back again whole. I know it
sounds crazy, but <br>
TROI: It's not crazy about it. You are being taken apart molecule by
molecule. Reg, you're not the first person to have anxiety about
transporting. We can desensitise you to this type of fear. It's a slow
and gradual process, but it works. <br>
BARCLAY: It does? How? <br>
TROI: Well, you might first try a relaxation technique, like plexing. <br>
BARCLAY: Plexing? <br>
TROI: Yes, it's a Betazoid method. The next time you feel nervous about
transporting, you stimulate a neural pressure point, like this. <br>
(Troi taps behind her right ear) <br>
TROI: There's a nerve cluster just behind the carotid artery. It
stimulates the part of the brain that releases natural endorphins. <br>
BARCLAY: Plexing. Sounds easy enough. <br>
(Troi guides Barclay's fingers to the right place) <br>
TROI: Here. There. <br>
BARCLAY: You know, I feel better already. I think I can do this. <br>
TROI: There's no need to rush. <br>
BARCLAY: No, no. We talked about confronting my fears. The best way out
is through. You said that once, remember? <br>
TROI: I suppose I did. <br>
BARCLAY: I'm going to beam over there. I can do it.

O'BRIEN: No. Arachnids. Sickening, crawly little things, don't you
think? All those legs. <br>
BARCLAY: Spiders? They've never bothered me. <br>
O'BRIEN: A few years back, I was called in to re-route an emitter array
at a Starbase on Zayra Four. Turns out the entire system was infested
with Talarian hook spiders. You ever seen a Talarian hook spider? Their
legs are half a metre long. Well, I had a choice. Do I walk away and
let the emitter blow itself to hell, or do I crawl in the Jeffries tube
with twenty hook spiders? <br>
BARCLAY: What happened? <br>
O'BRIEN: It was the hardest thing I ever did, but I got through it.
After that, I was never quite as afraid of spiders. <br>

PICARD: Is there any evidence to support this? <br>
HAYES [on monitor]: Although I'm loathe to believe the Ferengi about
anything, there was evidence of Cardassian weapons. If the Cardassians
also attacked the Yosemite, it could indicate a large scale movement
into this sector. <br>
PICARD: I have an away team on board the ship. The initial report
indicates there was an explosion on board, but we're not sure if it was
from an attack. <br>

they're all scrambled. Looks like the blast wiped out the ship's core
memory. <br>
BARCLAY: We could try to reconstitute the data stream. <br>
LAFORGE: It's worth a try. <br>
BARCLAY: Commander, has anything strange ever happened to you during
transport? <br>
LAFORGE: Like what? <br>
BARCLAY: I don't know. Anything out of the ordinary. <br>
LAFORGE: No, not really. This looks hopeless. We're not going to get
anything out of these logs. You know, maybe this broken sample
container I found can tell us something. Let's try to get this thing
back into one piece. <br>
BARCLAY: I mean, have you ever seen anything? <br>

BARCLAY: In the, during transport. <br>
LAFORGE: Sometimes my visor picks up resonance patterns from the matter
energy conversion. It's actually kind of pretty. Why? <br>
BARCLAY: Just wondering. <br>
LAFORGE: Reg, what are you getting at? Did you saw something during
transport? <br>
BARCLAY: When I was returning to the Enterprise I could've sworn I saw
something in the matter stream. <br>
LAFORGE: Something? <br>
BARCLAY: There was phased matter all around. At first I thought it was
some kind of energy discharge, but then it flew toward me and it
touched my arm. How could something be in there? Molecules flying
apart, half phased? I mean, it's impossible, isn't it? <br>

full diagnostic on the transporter, all right? <br>

So do the phase transition coils. <br>

O'BRIEN: Emitter pads, targeting scanners, they're all working fine.
This system's clean. So is the science vessel's. <br>
LAFORGE: Reg, there's a lot of energy floating around in the beam.
Maybe you saw a surge in the matter stream. <br>
BARCLAY: Yeah. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll run a scan on the Heisenberg compensators. <br>
BARCLAY: No, Chief, you've done enough already. <br>
O'BRIEN: It's no problem. Why don't you give me a hand? <br>
BARCLAY: You know, maybe ignorance really is bliss. <br>
O'BRIEN: Sir? <br>
BARCLAY: Well, if I didn't know so much about these things, maybe they
wouldn't scare me so much. I can still remember the day in Doctor
Olafson's Transporter Theory class when he was talking about the body
being converted into billions of kiloquads of data, zipping through
subspace, and I realised there's no margin for error. One atom out of
place and poof! You never come back. It's amazing people aren't lost
all the time. <br>
O'BRIEN: With all due respect, sir, I've been doing this for twenty two
years and I haven't lost anybody yet. <br>
BARCLAY: Yes, but you realise if these imaging scanners are off even a
thousandth of a percent. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's why each pad has four redundant scanners. If any one
scanner fails, the other three take over. <br>
LAFORGE: Reg, how many transporter accidents have there been in the
last ten years? Two? Three? There are millions of people who transport
safely every day without a problem. <br>
BARCLAY: I've heard of problems. What about transporter psychosis? <br>
O'BRIEN: Transporter Psychosis? There hasn't been a case of that in
over fifty years. Not since they perfected the multiplex pattern
buffers. <br>

COMPUTER: Transporter psychosis was diagnosed in the year twenty two oh
nine by researchers on Delinia Two. <br>
BARCLAY: No, no stop. All I need is, what causes it? <br>
COMPUTER: It is caused by a breakdown of neuro-chemical molecules
during transport, affecting the body's motor functions, autonomic
systems, and the brain's higher reasoning centres. <br>
BARCLAY: What are the symptoms? <br>

if he was exposed to ionised gas or high energy plasma. <br>

believe your hypothesis was correct. It was used to store high energy
plasma. <br>

I'm giving you an order, Mister O'Brien. <br>
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. If you don't mind my making an observation, sir, you
forgot to bring a tricorder. <br>
BARCLAY: Either there's something in there or I'm going crazy, and I've
just got to know. You can understand that, can't you? <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes sir, I can. Stand by, sir. <br>
(as Barclay is beamed back and forth, that maggot thing is in the
sparkles) <br>
BARCLAY: I want you to wake the senior staff.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Crusher is scanning Barclay's arm) <br>
BARCLAY: Then I saw it again, just twenty minutes ago. It was the same
exact thing just moving around in the transporter beam. <br>
RIKER: Let me get this straight. You think this thing was alive? <br>
BARCLAY: It was dark and distorted, and it had what looked like a
mouth. <br>
WORF: A mouth. <br>
CRUSHER: I don't see anything wrong with his arm. <br>
TROI: Reg, why did you wait so long to tell anybody about your arm? <br>
BARCLAY: Well, I thought I was hallucinating, that I had, that it was
transporter psychosis. But now I know what I saw in there was real. I
was the only one who experienced ionic fluctuations in the transport.
Maybe that's why no one else saw it. <br>
PICARD: Mister Barclay, I've been told you've been under a considerable
amount of strain the past couple of days. Isn't it possible that you
simply imagined <br>
BARCLAY: I know what you're going to say, Captain. I know I've been
acting strange lately. But you've got to believe me. I would never have
called you in here unless I was absolutely certain. <br>
PICARD: Commander La Forge, get Mister O'Brien. Take that transporter
system apart piece by piece if you have to. Mister Worf, I want a level
three security alert until further notice. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
CRUSHER: I'll run a micro-cellular scan of Mister Barclay's arm. It
might take some time, but if there's a problem, I'll find it. <br>
PICARD: Keep me apprised. Dismissed.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: I'm reading minute levels of residual
ionisation in the subdermal tissue of his left arm. The patterns
correspond exactly to those we measured in Lieutenant Kelly's body and
in the sample container from the science ship. There's no question. You
have been exposed to the same high energy plasma they were. <br>
BARCLAY: So something did happen to me in the transporter beam. <br>
CRUSHER: You might've been exposed to something from the science ship.
You did say something touched your left arm during transport, and
that's exactly where the ionisation is focused. <br>
RIKER: Does this ionisation pose a threat to Mister Barclay? <br>
CRUSHER: It might. I'll have to run a base pair correlation to see if
there's any sign of DNA breakdown. <br>
BARCLAY: Sir, Commander La Forge and I were planning to recreate the
circumstances of the explosion on the Yosemite. That might give us some
answers. Permission to continue with the experiment? <br>
RIKER: Granted. Tell Mister O'Brien to take all the primary
transporters offline. I don't want to risk any further contaminations.
Make sure you take all the necessary safety precautions. <br>
BARCLAY: Aye, sir. <br>
CRUSHER: I'd like you to wear this monitoring device. It will tell me
if there's the slightest sign of increased ionisation. <br>
(she fastens a band around his left arm) <br>
BARCLAY: Yes, Doctor.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Structural reinforcement is at two hundred
forty percent. <br>
(a sample container is sitting on a table in the middle of the floor) <br>
LAFORGE: Activating containment field. Well, that should do it. Okay,
Reg. We've locked onto the coordinates of the plasma streamer. Go ahead
and beam aboard a sample, will you? <br>
BARCLAY: Aye, sir. <br>
(the container fills with pink) <br>
LAFORGE: Okay. What would they have done first? <br>
DATA: A standard analysis begins with a resonance frequency scan. <br>
LAFORGE: That sounds like a good place to start. Let's get it done. <br>
DATA: Initiating resonance sweep. Frequency range at three <br>
(the container blows apart) <br>
LAFORGE: Barclay, check the containment field. <br>
BARCLAY: The field is at its maximum limit, but it is holding. <br>
LAFORGE: My visor's picking up bio-magnetic energy. Highly complex
patterns. You know, I think these things are alive. Reg. <br>

LAFORGE: Reg? (Barclay has a lot of purple skin now) Reg.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BARCLAY: Life forms? <br>
DATA: That is correct. They appear to be quasi-energy microbes that
exist within the distortion field of the plasma streamer. <br>
LAFORGE: We didn't detect them until we tried to run the resonance
frequency scan. Apparently, they didn't like it very much. They
shattered the sample container. <br>
BARCLAY: Which caused a plasma explosion similar to the one on the
science ship. <br>
LAFORGE: Exactly. When we linked up with their transporter system, one
or more of the microbes must have got into our system. We think they're
still caught in the buffer. It might explain what you saw. <br>
BARCLAY: But what I saw was much bigger than a microbe. <br>
DATA: Normal spatial relationships are often distorted within the
matter stream. Your perceptions may have been exaggerated. <br>
CRUSHER: Some of these microbes are also in your body, Reg. <br>
BARCLAY: Inside me? <br>
CRUSHER: They were in Lieutenant Kelly's body as well. That's what
caused the contractions during the autopsy. <br>
LAFORGE: The biofilter should have screened them out but it didn't. <br>
DATA: The microbes exist simultaneously as both matter and energy. The
biofilter cannot distinguish them from the matter stream. <br>
LAFORGE: Right, but if we held Barclay suspended in mid-transport at
the point where matter starts to lose molecular cohesion. <br>
DATA: The molecules would begin to emit nucleonic particles. We may be
able to derive a pattern the computer would recognise. <br>
LAFORGE: And then reprogram the biofilters to screen the microbes out.
I think this'll work, Reg. <br>
BARCLAY: Suspend me? I don't like the sound of this. <br>
LAFORGE: We'd have to hold you in there for a while. <br>
BARCLAY: How long? <br>
LAFORGE: Thirty, forty seconds. It's tough to tell. But I think it'd be
safe. <br>
BARCLAY: But if I'm in the matter stream too long. <br>
DATA: Your pattern would degrade to the point where your signal would
be permanently lost. </font></p>

equipment) <br>
O'BRIEN: After fifteen seconds or so in the beam, you may start to feel
light-headed. Try to stay calm. Oh, and it's important not to move
around too much. <br>
BARCLAY: Right. <br>
O'BRIEN: Initialising the back-up pattern buffer. Holding at stand by. <br>
LAFORGE: Ready, Reg? <br>
BARCLAY: Energise. <br>
O'BRIEN: Molecular resolution at sixty percent. Engaging static mode.
His pattern is locked and holding. <br>
LAFORGE: Starting biofilter scan. <br>
(Barclay sees a maggot in the matter stream) <br>
O'BRIEN: Signal's holding. <br>
CRUSHER: The imaging scanners still haven't isolated the microbes. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll try increasing molecular dispersion. <br>
LAFORGE: His signal resolution's dropped to fifty five percent. <br>
O'BRIEN: Don't worry. I can hold him together. <br>
(the huge 'microbe' is eye to eye with Barclay) <br>
O'BRIEN: Commander, the signal resolution's down to fifty percent. We
need to bring him back. <br>
LAFORGE: I know, I know. Just give me one more second. We need more
dispersion. Increase phase transition frequency <br>
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. <br>
CRUSHER: The imaging scanners are actuating. <br>
LAFORGE: Got it. Pattern acquisition Positive. <br>
O'BRIEN: Programming biofilter. <br>
LAFORGE: Don't worry, Reg. This won't hurt a bit. <br>
(now there are three 'microbes' with Barclay. He grabs the first one
and clutches it to his chest) <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm reading a ninety two percent increase in mass! <br>
LAFORGE: There's something in the beam with him. Security to
Transporter room three. <br>
WORF [OC]: Right away. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm setting up a force field round the chamber. <br>
(Barclay is materialised with his back to them, holding another person.
They both fall to the floor) <br>
CRUSHER: Drop the force field. <br>
(Worf and two security personnel enter) <br>
BARCLAY: There are more crew members in the beam. You have to grab them
and hold on. <br>
WORF: Understood. Follow me. <br>
LAFORGE: Reg, what happened? <br>
BARCLAY: Well, when I saw there was more than one of them, I thought
maybe the other crew was trying the same thing that we were. <br>
CREWMAN: We're infected with something. Lieutenant Kelly tried to
reprogram the biofilter <br>
LAFORGE: It looks like he pushed molecular dispersion past the
integrity point. Your patterns got caught in the beam. <br>
BARCLAY: The residual energy from the plasma streamer. It must've
amplified the charge in the buffer enough to keep your patterns from
degrading. <br>

is the first time we've ever spoken outside of the Transporter room. <br>
BARCLAY: Well, to be honest, I always avoided you. <br>
O'BRIEN: Why? <br>
BARCLAY: Because you run the transporters, and I hate the transporters.
At least, I used to. So, what's in the box? <br>
O'BRIEN: I thought you might like to meet Christina. Christina,
Lieutenant Barclay. <br>
BARCLAY: It's your pet spider. <br>
O'BRIEN: Lycosa tarantula. Don't worry, she won't bite. <br>
