WORF: A warrior's drink. <br>
GUINAN: You know, you're always drinking alone. It wouldn't hurt you to
seek out a little companionship. <br>
WORF: I would require a Klingon woman for companionship. Earth females
are too fragile. <br>

hull and engine materials conform to engineering patterns and methods
of that time period. <br>
WESLEY: (in full Starfleet uniform) But that cruiser was destroyed with
all hands over twenty years ago. <br>
DATA: Presumed destroyed. The Enterprise C was last seen near the
Klingon outpost Narendra Three exactly twenty two years, three months
and four days ago. <br>
RIKER: And now they're here. <br>
PICARD: Has it been adrift for all those years, or has it has travelled
through time? <br>
DATA: It is a possibility, Captain. If that hypothesis is correct, the
phenomenon we just
encountered would be a temporal rift in space. <br>
PICARD: A rift? <br>
DATA Possibly the formation of a Kerr loop from superstring material.
It would require high-energy interactions
occurring in the vicinity for such a structure to be formed. The rift
is certainly not stable, Captain. It could collapse at any time. <br>
TASHA: Captain. I'm able to scan the interior of the ship now, sir.

from, they are here now and they need our help. <br>
PICARD: Commander, if that ship has travelled into the future, we could
be dealing with variables that will alter the flow of our history. <br>
TASHA: Enterprise C is sending out a distress call, sir. Audio only. <br>
GARRETT [OC]: This is Captain Garrett of the Starship Enterprise, to
any Federation ship. We have been attacked by Romulan warships and
require immediate assistance. We've lost warp drive. Life support is
failing. <br>
RIKER: There's no record of the Romulans ever assaulting the Enterprise
C. <br>

automated distress signal now. <br>
PICARD: Open a hailing frequency. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of
the Federation, of a Federation starship. Standby to receive emergency

returned, we'd be destroyed. <br>

GARRETT: There was a fierce volley of photon torpedoes. We were hit. A
bright light, and then here. <br>
PICARD: It is possible that this exchange of fire was the catalyst for
the formation of a temporal rift. History has no record of your battle
with the Romulans. <br>
GARRETT: We were responding to a distress call from the Klingon outpost
on Narendra Three. The Romulans were attacking it. We engaged them, but
there were four warbirds. <br>

that you did not succeed. A Federation starship rescuing a Klingon

briefing. I'm not seeking your consent. <br>
RIKER: With all due respect, sir, you'd be asking one hundred and
twenty five people to die a meaningless death. <br>
DATA: Not necessarily meaningless, Commander. The Klingons regard
honour above all else. If the crew of the Enterprise-C had died
fighting for the survival of a Klingon outpost, it would be considered
a meaningful act of honour by the Klingon Empire. <br>
PICARD: Even their deaths might have prevented this war. If the
Enterprise-C returns to the battle and its mission is a success,
history will be irrevocably changed. This time line will cease to exist

GARRETT: No, I suppose not. You don't belong in our time any more than
we belong in yours. To be honest, Picard, a significant number of my
crewmembers have expressed a desire to return, even knowing the odds.
Some because they can't bear to live without their loved ones, some
because they don't like the idea of slipping out in the middle of a
fight. But I have told them that in the here and now, the Federation
needs another ship against the Klingons. And we'd better get used to
being in the here and now. <br>

war is going very badly for the Federation, far worse than is generally
known. Starfleet Command believes defeat is inevitable. Within six
months we may have no choice but to surrender. <br>

twenty two years ago, one ship could have stopped this war before it
started. <br>
GARRETT: Mister Castillo. <br>
CASTILLO: Yes, Captain? <br>
GARRETT: Inform the crew we're going back. <br>
CASTILLO: Yes, Captain. <br>
GARRETT: The Romulans will get a good fight. We'll make it one for the
history books. <br>
PICARD: I know you will, Captain. Lieutenant Yar? <br>
TASHA: Permission to remain for a moment, sir. <br>
PICARD: Granted. <br>
GARRETT: Transporter room, Captain Picard is ready to return to his
ship. <br>
CREWMAN [OC]: Aye, Captain. <br>
TASHA: I just wanted to say good luck. <br>
CASTILLO: I'll try to put some of your tactical briefing to good use
when we get back. <br>
TASHA: Your ship has much more manoeuvrability than the Romulan
counterparts of that era. Actually, if you could just isolate... You'll
do fine. <br>
CASTILLO: If you get back to Earth and you see a man, say, in his late
fifties taking a hard look across a crowded room. Hey, you never know. <br>
TASHA: Goodbye, Lieutenant. <br>
(weapons impact. Tasha dives to the ops console and starts working) <br>
GARRETT: Red Alert! Full power to shields. <br>
TASHA: Shields are up. Functioning. <br>
CASTILLO: Initiating evasive manoeuvres. Gamma sequence. <br>
GARRETT: Ready phasers. Enterprise-D </font></p>

myself, Captain Picard. <br>
RIKER: Sir, Lieutenant Castillo is the last surviving senior officer.
He will have limited support from Ops, no Tactical, reduced staff in
Engineering. <br>
CASTILLO: I have good people willing to do their best. <br>
RIKER: Certainly, history never meant for this ship to go into battle
without her captain. <br>
CASTILLO: I can't speak to that point, sir, but I can get us back to
where we're supposed to be. I believe that's what Captain Garrett would
want me to do. <br>
DATA [OC]: Commander Data to Captain Picard. <br>
PICARD: Go ahead. <br>
DATA [OC]: Sir, sensors are showing additional instability in the time
rift. Possibly the result of the battle with the Klingons. <br>
PICARD: Any signs of other Klingon vessels? <br>
DATA [OC]: No, sir. <br>
TASHA: Our coordinates have been transmitted to the Klingon command,
sir. We mustn't remain here. <br>
CASTILLO: Sir, it is my intention to return, unless you order me not
to. <br>
PICARD: How soon can your ship be ready? <br>
CASTILLO: We sustained moderate damage in the attack. I think we can
get underway in a few hours. <br>
PICARD: Make it so. We'll give you cover. </font></p>

is. <br>

TASHA: Guinan, I have to know something. What happens to me in the
other time line? <br>
GUINAN: I don't have alternate biographies of the crew. As I said to
the captain, it's just a feeling. <br>
TASHA: But there's something more when you look at me, isn't there? I
can see it in your eyes, Guinan. We've known each other too long. <br>
GUINAN: We weren't meant to know each other at all. At least, that's
what I sense when I look at you. Tasha, you're not supposed to be here.
<br>
TASHA: Where am I supposed to be? <br>
GUINAN: Dead. <br>
TASHA: Do you know how? <br>
GUINAN: No. But I do know it was an empty death. A death without
purpose.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Come. Yes, Lieutenant? <br>
TASHA: Captain, I request a transfer to the Enterprise-C. <br>
PICARD: For what reason? <br>
TASHA: They need someone at Tactical. <br>
PICARD: We need you here. <br>
TASHA: I'm not supposed to be here, sir. <br>
PICARD: Sit down, Lieutenant. What did she say to you? <br>
TASHA: I don't belong here, sir. I'm supposed to be dead. <br>
PICARD: She felt it necessary to reveal that to you? <br>
TASHA: I felt it was necessary. <br>
PICARD: I see. You realise that it is very possible the Enterprise-C
will fail. We will continue in this time line in which case your life,
hopefully, will continue for a long while. <br>
TASHA: I know how important it is that they don't fail, Captain. That's
why I'm requesting this transfer. <br>
PICARD: You don't belong on that ship, Lieutenant. <br>
TASHA: No, Captain Garrett belongs on that ship. But she's dead. And I
think there's a certain logic in this request. <br>
PICARD: There's no logic in this at all. Whether they succeed or not,
the Enterprise-C will be destroyed. <br>
TASHA: But Captain, at least with someone at Tactical, they will have a
chance to defend themselves well. It may be a matter of seconds or
minutes, but those could be the minutes that change history. Guinan
says I died a senseless death in the other time line. I didn't like the
sound of that, Captain. I've always known the risks that come with a
Starfleet uniform. If I'm to die in one, I'd like my death to count for
something. <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant. Permission granted. <br>
TASHA: Thank you, sir.

battle. We're not coming back. <br>
TASHA: I know the mission. These are my orders, Lieutenant. <br>
