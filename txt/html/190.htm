Captain's Log, Stardate 44614.6. We are approaching Starbase three one

transport to a Federation outpost in the Guernica System. During the
journey we will be hosting a special guest.

LAFORGE: You wanted to see me, Captain? <br>
PICARD: Yes, Mister La Forge. It seems that the exemplary nature of
your work has caught the attention of Starfleet Command. In fact,
someone is coming on board just to see the engine modifications you've
made. <br>
LAFORGE: Who, Captain? <br>
PICARD: The Senior Design Engineer of the Theoretical Propulsion Group.
Doctor Leah Brahms. <br>
LAFORGE: Leah is coming here? This is terrific. <br>
PICARD: It is? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, I mean, I've studied her schematics for years. She was
responsible for a lot of the engine design on the Enterprise. <br>
PICARD: Well, it should be a very enjoyable visit, then. She'll be
transporting on board as soon as we reach the Starbase. Would you like
to greet her on our behalf? <br>
LAFORGE: I would love to, Captain. Thank you.

GUINAN: If you keep picking at that uniform you'll wear it out. <br>
LAFORGE: I guess I am a little nervous. It's not every day a man comes
face to face with his dream. <br>
GUINAN: What? <br>
LAFORGE: You remember about a year ago when we were caught in that
booby trap the Menthars set? Okay. While we were trying to get out of
it, I went down to the holodeck to study an engine prototype that was
made when the Enterprise was first designed. And the computer, well, it
gave me an image of the engine but it also created this hologram of the
designer. Doctor Leah Brahms. <br>
GUINAN: So you met a computer-simulated female. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, but not an ordinary computer-simulated female. I mean,
she was brilliant, of course, but warm, you know? Friendly. It' was
like we worked as one. I would start a sentences, she'd finish it. What
I didn't think of, she did. It was just so comfortable. <br>
Okay, I know it was just a holographic image but the computer was able
to incorporate personality traits from her Starfleet record. <br>
GUINAN: You know, Geordi, everybody falls in love with a fantasy every
now and then. <br>
LAFORGE: No, no, Guinan, see, you've got it all wrong. I'm not
necessarily expecting anything romantic here. It's just I know
whatever, Leah Brahms and I are going to be good friends.

LEAH: The matter-antimatter ratio has been changed. The mixture isn't
as rich as regulations dictate. <br>
LAFORGE: Experience has shown me that too high a ratio diminishes
efficiency. I worked with the mixture until I got the right balance. <br>
LEAH: The magnetic plasma transfer to the warp field generators doesn't
correspond to the recommended specs. <br>
LAFORGE: Right. Again, I adjusted the flow. Sometimes things happen a
little differently here is space than they do on the drawing board. <br>
LEAH: Is that a criticism, Commander? <br>
LAFORGE: No, of course not. It's just a well known fact. There's theory
and there's application. They don't always jibe. <br>
LEAH: You've charted a completely new swap-out schedule for main
components replacement. <br>
LAFORGE: You bet. I found the Starfleet estimates for the MTBF units to
be unrealistic. I simply determined my own schedule based on
observation and experience. <br>
LEAH: Is that going to be your only defence, Commander, that same tired
rhetoric? Out here in the field we learn things you designers couldn't
possibly understand. <br>
LAFORGE: In the first place, Doctor, I'm not aware of needing any
defence. And in the second place, if you're determined to be. <br>
CREWWOMAN [OC]: Doctor Brahms, you have an incoming message on
subspace. <br>
LEAH: I'd like to hear this message privately. <br>

discern

LAFORGE: You remember, the crystal's been reoriented to adjust the
direction of the lattice structure. <br>
LEAH: Remember? Why would I remember? <br>
LAFORGE: Right, why would you? Well, the ship was experiencing some
difficulty, and we made this adjustment hoping that it would work, and
it did. <br>
LEAH: So it was your idea? <br>
LAFORGE: Not exclusively, no. <br>
LEAH: It's curious. this modification was due to be introduced. <br>
LAFORGE: In the next class starship. <br>
LEAH: Yes. How did you know? <br>
LAFORGE: I didn't. I mean, well, it's the next logical step, right?
Listen, Doctor, sometimes we have to fly by the seat of our pants out
here so it stands to reason that once in a while we're going to come up
with the same solutions you do. Listen. I've got a personnel
review scheduled to start in about five minutes, and I know it's been a
long day for you. So, why don't we get together later? Sort of plan our
agenda for the next day or two? <br>
LEAH: Agenda? <br>
LAFORGE: What it is we want to accomplish here, how we might best go
about that, maybe even get to know each other a little bit. It might
make this easier. <br>

I'd say that the offspring is still premature. Otherwise, it would be
able to break through the outer body shell of the parent. <br>

parent? <br>
CRUSHER: There's no way to tell. We don't have enough information about

seven hours. <br>

longer, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Your help would be appreciated, Doctor. <br>
LAFORGE: By then, Junior may not need us any more. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, is there any way to determine what the destination
of the parent might have been? <br>
DATA: I can attempt to extrapolate from the heading it was on when we
encountered it, sir. <br>
CRUSHER: Perhaps it was its way to a safe and supportive environment
for its newborn. <br>
PICARD: We might be able to deliver it to the same destination. <br>
RIKER: Which brings up the question of how do we get Junior off the
hull once we get there. <br>
LEAH: It's almost completely covering the door of shuttlebay two. If we
open the door and deactivate the atmospheric force field. <br>
LAFORGE: the pressure from inside the ship might push it away from the
hull. <br>
PICARD: Make it so. <br>

reoriented the dilithium crystal. <br>

have a baseline reference for your modifications. And now I find that
it's all about a fantasy plaything. <br>

LEAH: I'm outraged by this. I have been invaded. Violated. How dare you
use me like this? How far did it go, anyway? Was it good for you? <br>

collaboration. <br>
LEAH: Oh, I can tell. Every time you're touching the engine you're
touching me. Real professional. <br>
LAFORGE: Look, if you watched the whole programme, you saw what it was.
We were working together to solve a problem in a crisis situation. <br>
LEAH: How do I know how far it went? How many other programs did you
create? Perhaps dozens of them, one for every day of the week, one for
every mood. <br>
LAFORGE: All right, look. Ever since you came on board, you've been
badgering me and I've taken it. I've shown you courtesy, and respect,
and a hell of a lot of patience. Oh, no, no, no, wait a minute. I've
tried to understand you. I've tried to get along with you. And in
return, you've accused, tried and convicted me without bothering to
hear my side of it. So, I'm guilty, okay? But not of what you think. Of
something much worse. I'm guilty of reaching out to you, of hoping we
could connect. I'm guilty of a terrible crime, Doctor. I offered you
friendship.
