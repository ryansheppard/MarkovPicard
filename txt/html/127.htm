LAFORGE: Each of these units will have total environmental control.
Gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light, all in a protective stasis
field. <br>
RIKER: And these get put into the large containment unit. <br>
LAFORGE: Right. See, these modules will keep the specimens alive, but
it's this large containment area that's going to keep us alive. Now, I
have to go and replicate this five hundred and twelve times, which
means I'll have to divert power from the warp engines to the replicator
for a while. <br>
PICARD: How long will we be on impulse power? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Lieutenant La Forge, status report. <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: The containment area is completed, Captain, and the last
of the modules are being inserted. <br>
PICARD: Take us to warp six as soon as possible. <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: Acknowledged. <br>
PICARD: This is Doctor Katherine Pulaski. We will handle the formal
introduction later. Counsellor Deanna Troi is pregnant. She is going to
have a baby. <br>
RIKER: Baby? This is a surprise. <br>
(Deanna is sitting alone at the end, somewhat embarrassed) <br>
TROI: More so for me. <br>
PULASKI: This pregnancy is unlike anything I have ever encountered.
Since she came to me a few hours ago, I have done two complete
examinations of Counsellor Troi. (goes to wall screen) This is from the
first examination. The foetus is about halfway through the first
trimester, about six weeks old. Now, understand we believe conception
took place eleven hours ago. <br>
RIKER: What? <br>
PULASKI: It gets better. This is the second exam one hour later. Now,
it's consistent, except for the fact that it appears the foetus is
several weeks older. At this growth rate, Counsellor Troi will have her
baby in about thirty six hours. The normal gestation rate for a
Betazoid is ten months. <br>
RIKER: I don't mean to be indelicate, but who's the father? <br>
TROI: Last night, while I slept, something which I can only describe as
a presence, entered my body. <br>
PICARD: A life form of unknown origin and intent is breeding right now
inside Counsellor Troi. Our purpose here is to determine what is to be
done about this very unusual situation. Discussion. <br>
RIKER: No, wait. Let me get this straight. Deanna was impregnated by by
what? Doctor, what do the tests show? Is it a humanoid? An alien? <br>
PULASKI: It's a male human, or in this case half-human half-Betazoid. <br>
RIKER: Exactly the same as Deanna. <br>
PULASKI: In every way. In fact, there is nothing to indicate that there
are any genetic patterns other than hers. <br>
RIKER: I don't think this is a random occurrence. I think there's a
purpose here. A reason. What, I don't know. <br>
WORF: Captain, obviously the pregnancy must be terminated for the
safety of the ship and crew. <br>
RIKER: Worf, you can't assume the intent was belligerent. <br>
WORF: That is the safest assumption. <br>
DATA: Captain, this is a life form. Not to allow it to develop
naturally would deny us the opportunity to study it. <br>
WORF: If the foetus is aborted, laboratory analysis is still possible. <br>
RIKER: Doctor, is there any health risk to Counsellor Troi if the
foetus is aborted? <br>
TROI: Captain, do whatever you feel is necessary to protect the ship
and the crew, but know this. I'm going to have this baby. <br>
PICARD: Then it seems that the discussion is over.

arrived at 'audet Nine, where we will pick up the specimens of plasma

Commander Hester Dealt, Medical Trustee, Federation Medical Collection
Station. <br>
PICARD: Are the specimens ready for transfer? <br>
DEALT [on viewscreen]: Yes, but with your permission I would like to
inspect the containment area before we proceed. Now it's not that I
doubt the ability of your crew, but we cannot afford a mistake. <br>
PICARD: I appreciate your caution. In the like vein, I want a complete,
detailed manifest of everything you intend to bring on board my ship. <br>
DEALT [on viewscreen]: Very good. I will allow access you to my
computer banks, okay? <br>
(transmission ends) <br>

the medical computer. Number One, arrange to have Hester Dealt
transported up. </font></p>

TROI: We're doing fine. I was just about to get him his supper. <br>
IAN: Do you want your supper now, too? <br>
PICARD: No, Ian, but thank you for the invitation. <br>
IAN: You're welcome. Have you ever played with puppies? <br>
TROI: They had a litter today in the nursery. <br>
PICARD: No, Ian, I don't think I've played with puppies. <br>
IAN: You should come to the nursery while the puppies are still there. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps later. <br>
(Ian puts his finger in his hot soup) <br>
IAN: Ow! Mom. <br>

IAN: My face is wet. <br>
TROI: Is that better, sweetheart? Everything's going to be fine. <br>
PULASKI: He allowed himself to be burned. <br>
PICARD: For the experience. <br>
PULASKI: Who is he? Why is he here? What does he want? <br>
PICARD: Ian, could you tell us why you are here? <br>
IAN: Because Mommy said it was time to eat. <br>
PICARD: No, I mean, why you are here on this ship? <br>
IAN: I live here. <br>
TROI: Ian, I think the Captain wants to know if you are ready to tell
us why you came here. <br>
IAN: No, not yet. <br>
TROI: The answer is within him. When his cognitive powers have
sufficiently developed, he will be able to articulate it. <br>
PICARD: I hope he will tell us soon.&nbsp;<br>

WESLEY: I try. <br>
GUINAN: Even if it's not what you really want? <br>
WESLEY: Sometimes. Sometimes it's more important to consider others
before yourself. <br>
GUINAN: Yes. But sometimes the game is to know when to consider
yourself before others. Give yourself permission to be selfish.

COMPUTER: (male) All circuits functional. <br>
LAFORGE: Environment's as programmed. Temperature ninety seven degrees
Kelvin. Radiation flux zero. Stasis field nominal. Everything exactly
as it should be, right down the line. <br>
DATA: Perhaps it is a sensor malfunction. Computer, inquiry. Is growth
actually occurring in module L seven three? <br>
COMPUTER: Confirmed. <br>

RIKER: Doctor, one of the specimens is growing. <br>
PULASKI: Destroy it now. <br>
DEALT: I can't. <br>
RIKER: Data, prepare to jettison the module. <br>
DEALT: We can't do that either. It will go into a spore and remain
until it comes in contact with a planet or another ship. The results
would be disastrous. <br>
RIKER: Commander, your attitude tells me that however bad I think it
is, it's actually worse. <br>
DEALT: This is not going to hold it. <br>
RIKER: Go on. <br>
DEALT: The rate of growth is increasing so rapidly, within thirty
minutes it's going to push out of it's module. Within two hours, it'll
break out of the containment area. <br>
LAFORGE: No, no, no. It can't break through this. <br>

know how it was developed? <br>
DEALT: Yes, it's right over here. <br>
PULASKI: It's a mutated strain developed by Doctor Susan Nuress during
an outbreak of plasma plague seventy years ago in the Oby System. It
was number nine in a series of fifty eight tests. This particular one
bombarded by low levels of Eichner radiation. Could exposure to Eichner
radiation stimulate growth? <br>
DEALT: It could, but I. I've got something. <br>
RIKER: Why didn't you detect this before? <br>
DEALT: I don't know. It wasn't here before. <br>
PULASKI: Well, it is now. What emits that type of radiation? <br>
DATA: A subspace phase inverter. <br>
LAFORGE: We don't have one. <br>

RIKER: Apparently so. <br>
TROI: He is a life force entity. When we passed each other in space, he
was curious about us, so he decided the best way to learn was to go
through the process. To be born, to live as one of us and in that way
to understand us. He never meant any harm. <br>
