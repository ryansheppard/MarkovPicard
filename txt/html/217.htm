Captain's log, stardate 45614.6. We have been contacted by an
androgynous race called the J'naii to investigate the mysterious
disappearance of one of their shuttlecraft.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(the J'naii are wearing loose-fitting one-piece
suits and all have short hair) <br>
DATA: Captain, we are approaching the designated coordinates. <br>
PICARD: On screen. Long range scan, Mister Data. <br>
DATA: Sensors find no evidence of the shuttle anywhere within the star
system. <br>
SOREN: It couldn't have travelled outside the system. <br>
RIKER: Mister Data, reconfigure high resolution sweep, radius one
million kilometres. Check for any debris. <br>
DATA: Scan shows no debris within that radius. <br>
KRITE: I don't understand it. A shuttle doesn't simply vanish. <br>
SOREN: There has to be an explanation. <br>
DATA: Captain, I am detecting an unusual reading. It appears to be a
neutrino emission with no visible source. <br>
PICARD: Explanation? <br>
DATA: I have none, sir. I recommend we launch a probe. <br>
PICARD: Make it so. <br>
WORF: Probe is launched. <br>
DATA: Sensors show no evidence of any unusual phenomenon. <br>
(then the probe vanishes) <br>
DATA: The probe is no longer transmitting. <br>
SOREN: What happened? Where did it go?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, supplemental. The sudden
disappearance of our probe suggests that we may have found the first
instance of what is called null space, an anomaly which until now had
been only theoretical. Commander Riker has been working around the
clock with a team of J'naii specialists to formalise this hypothesis.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SOREN: During the creation of a star system, when
clouds of interstellar dust and gas coalesce, turbulent regions of
magnetic and gravitational fields may develop. If certain conditions
occur, these fields can condense into abnormal pockets of space. <br>
RIKER: We think your system contains one of these null pockets. If
we're right, the pocket would absorb electromagnetic energy from
anything that entered it. <br>
SOREN: Like a shuttlecraft. <br>
RIKER: Or a probe. Making them powerless. <br>
SOREN: But outside the pocket, all the energy is bent around it, making
it naturally cloaked. That's why we cannot see it, and our sensors
cannot read it. <br>
NOOR: Is the shuttle still there? <br>
RIKER: We think so. The shuttle probably wasn't able to sustain its
energy, but other than that it wouldn't be damaged. <br>
SOREN: Since our shuttles carry plestorene based backup systems, we
think life support would sustain for as long as ten days. <br>
NOOR: Then perhaps our crew has survived. <br>
RIKER: We can send one of our own shuttles, but its energy would also
be absorbed. Our Chief Engineer is working on a way to maintain the
power reserves long enough to rescue your crew. <br>
NOOR: Commander, we're grateful for your help. Whatever resources we
can provide are yours. <br>
(the council members leave) <br>
SOREN: I've been thinking. When the time comes, I would like to pilot
the shuttle. <br>
RIKER: It's a Starfleet craft. <br>
SOREN: I cannot ask you to put yourself in danger to rescue our crew. <br>
RIKER: You can't pilot a shuttle you're not familiar with. <br>
SOREN: I happen to be a good pilot <br>
RIKER: I happen to be a good pilot, too. And I know my way around the
Starfleet shuttle. So what if we team up? <br>
SOREN: When can we go over the shuttle flight operations? <br>
RIKER: Right now.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(shuttle 15 Magellan, with Onizuku in the
foreground) <br>
SOREN: Is this the one? <br>
RIKER: This is it. Short-range craft, two twelve hundred fifty
millicochrane warp engines. <br>
SOREN: Looks like microfusion thrusters. <br>
RIKER: Right. <br>
SOREN: Armament? <br>
RIKER: None, usually. This one's been fitted with two type-four phaser
emitters. We'll use those to chart the null space. <br>
SOREN: Chart it? <br>
RIKER: Mister La Forge wants to get an idea of the size of the pocket.
He thinks the rate of energy absorption is linked to its size. <br>
SOREN: I'm not sure how we go about mapping something we can't see. <br>
RIKER: Well, that's where the emitters come in. We shoot out a series
of photon pulses into the pocket and chart where each one disappears.
From that we should get a fairly complete outline. <br>
SOREN: Let's take a look at the controls.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Shuttlecraft]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Later we'll try a flight simulation. Right
now let's do a systems review. I'll talk you through it. <br>
SOREN: Let me try it. Propulsion system, transfer conduits. Where's the
schematic reactor assembly? Oh, there it is. Engine nacelles. There's
nothing here that's unfamiliar. Navigational deflector, redundant
graviton polarity source generators. <br>
RIKER: You handle these controls like you grew up in a shuttle. <br>
SOREN: I did. My parents were pilots. I was flying with them before I
could walk. And as soon as I was old enough, I entered flight school.
Krite was my instructor. <br>
RIKER: He had a good student. <br>
SOREN: He? Commander, there are no he's or she's in a species without
gender. <br>
RIKER: Okay. For two days I've been trying to construct sentences
without personal pronouns. Now I give up. What should I use? It? To us,
that's rude. <br>
SOREN: We use a pronoun which is neutral. I do not think there is
really a translation. <br>
RIKER: Then I'll just have to muddle through. So forgive me if a stray
he or she slips by, okay? <br>
SOREN: Well, if that's the systems review, I don't see any problem.
What's next? <br>
RIKER: Lunch.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Ten Forward]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SOREN: What is it? <br>
RIKER: Split pea soup. It's my father's recipe. I had it programmed
into the replicators. Well? <br>
SOREN: Unusual, but I think I like it. <br>
RIKER: It's very healthy. Helps to keep you warm on cold Alaskan
nights. <br>
SOREN: We prefer to stay warm by sleeping with a friend. <br>
RIKER: I see. <br>
SOREN: Not to mate. Just to sleep together for warmth. <br>
RIKER: Still sounds better than pea soup. <br>
SOREN: We are puzzling to you, aren't we? <br>
RIKER: A little. It's hard to grasp the idea of no gender. <br>
SOREN: It's just as hard for us to understand the strange division in
your species. Males and females. You are male. Tell me about males.
What is it that makes you different from females? <br>
RIKER: Snips and snails and puppy dog tails? <br>
SOREN: You have a dog's tail? <br>
RIKER: It's an old nursery rhyme. Girls are made from sugar and spice,
and boys are made from snips and snails. <br>
SOREN: That makes it sound better to be female. <br>
RIKER: It's an old-fashioned way of looking at the sexes. Not to say
that there's no real difference between them. Physically, men are
bigger, stronger in the upper body. We have different sexual organs.
Men can't bear young. <br>
SOREN: And what about feelings, or emotional attitudes? Are they
different? <br>
RIKER: Most people think so. But that's the kind of question that would
take a lifetime to answer. Let me ask you, what's it like on a planet
where the people have no gender? <br>
SOREN: I'm afraid I don't understand. <br>
RIKER: Well, who leads when you dance? If you dance. <br>
SOREN: We do, and whoever's taller leads. <br>
RIKER: Without the battle of the sexes you probably don't have as many
arguments. <br>
SOREN: Just because we don't have gender doesn't mean we don't have
conflicts. We're very strong-minded. We love a good fight. <br>
RIKER: From the sound of it there's not that much difference between
our species. <br>
SOREN: Maybe not. What kind of woman do you find attractive? <br>
RIKER: I like one who's intelligent and sure of herself, who I can talk
with and get something back. But the most important thing of all? She
has to laugh at my jokes. <br>
SOREN: (smiling) Tell me, is that the kind of woman that all human
males prefer? <br>
RIKER: Not at all. Some like quiet, demure women. Others prefer a lot
of energy. Some only respond to physical attractiveness. Others
couldn't care less. There are no rules. <br>
SOREN: You make it sound very complex. <br>
RIKER: Believe me, it is. <br>
SOREN: Well, perhaps it is that complexity which makes differences in
the sexes so interesting. <br>
KRITE: Good evening, Commander. <br>
RIKER: Good evening. <br>
SOREN: Please take my place, Krite. I have to be going. Thank you for
going over the flight protocols, Commander. It was very helpful.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, supplemental. Commander Riker and

We'll start there and expand. <br>
RIKER: Stand by, forward phaser array. <br>
SOREN: Pulse vanished at delta four point two by point three. <br>
RIKER: Firing second burst. <br>
SOREN: Delta four point four by point five. <br>
RIKER: This is working. Initiating computer task hand-off. <br>
SOREN: Commander, tell me about your sexual organs. <br>
RIKER: Er. <br>
SOREN: Is that an uncomfortable subject for humans? <br>
RIKER: No, but it doesn't tend to be a topic of casual conversation. <br>
SOREN: I'm interested in your mating practices. What is involved with
two sexes? <br>
RIKER: Correcting course. Zero two one mark zero. <br>
SOREN: Mating? <br>
RIKER: Right. Well, it's pretty simple. Men inseminate the women. Women
carry the baby. <br>
SOREN: Our foetuses are incubated in fibrous husks, which the parents
inseminate. From what we know of other species, our method is less
risky and less painful. <br>
RIKER: And less enjoyable. <br>
SOREN: Less enjoyable? <br>
RIKER: For humans, the sexual act brings a closeness and intimacy. It
can be a very pleasurable experience. Inseminating a husk. <br>
SOREN: That's just the last step. Mating is a long ritual for us, full
of variety and invention. I assure you, it is extremely pleasurable. <br>
RIKER: I'm picking up a neutrino emission from within the null space. <br>
SOREN: That may be coming from our shuttle. I'll note these
coordinates. <br>
SOREN: I wonder. <br>
RIKER: What? <br>
SOREN: If a human and a J'naii would be sexually compatible. <br>
RIKER: I don't know. <br>
SOREN: Of course it would never be permitted. <br>
RIKER: Why not? <br>
SOREN: The idea of gender. It is offensive to my people. You see, long
ago we had two sexes, as you do. But we evolved into a higher form. I
don't mean to sound insulting, but on my planet we have been taught
that gender is primitive. <br>
RIKER: Primitive? <br>
SOREN: Less evolved. <br>
RIKER: Maybe so, but sometimes there's a lot to be said for an
experience that's primitive. <br>
SOREN: Delta five grid map is fully plotted. <br>
RIKER: Adjusting course. Zero two nine mark zero. <br>
(the shuttle's port nacelle workings are exposed) <br>
RIKER: The port engine's down. <br>
SOREN: Reducing power in the starboard nacelle. <br>
RIKER: That's not enough. I have to activate the manoeuvring thrusters.
<br>
SOREN: Thrusters aren't responding. I'll try to reroute the firing
sequence. <br>
RIKER: Inertial dampers are failing. Hang on! <br>
(Soren gets thrown across the floor) <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: Enterprise to shuttle, do you read me? <br>
RIKER: Affirmative. We've lost an engine. <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: We'll try to get a tractor beam on you. <br>
RIKER: The sooner the better. Enterprise, we have an injury. Transport
Soren directly to Sickbay. <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: Right away, Commander.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: It's just a mild concussion. You're going
to be fine. This will reduce the inflammation. <br>
SOREN: Doctor, you are female. <br>
CRUSHER: Yes. <br>
SOREN: Forgive me, I do not mean to be rude, but I'm curious. What is
it like? <br>
CRUSHER: Well, it's just the way I am. I've never really thought about
what it's like. <br>
SOREN: I've noticed you tend to have longer hair, and you arrange it
more elaborately. And you apply colour to your bodies. <br>
CRUSHER: Colour? <br>
SOREN: You put colour on your mouths, and your eyes, your cheeks, your
fingernails. The men don't. <br>
CRUSHER: That's true. <br>
SOREN: Then it is up to women to attract the men. <br>
CRUSHER: Oh, no. Men want to be attractive too, believe me. They just
go about it differently. <br>
SOREN: No colour. <br>
CRUSHER: No colour. They like to pretend they're not doing anything to
attract a woman, even when it's the most important thing on their
minds. <br>
SOREN: This is very confusing. Then, are women considered more
superior, or are men? <br>
CRUSHER: Neither. In the past, women were often considered weak and
inferior. But that hasn't been true for a long time. <br>
(Riker enters) <br>
CRUSHER: Will, your co-pilot is going to be fine. The injury was minor.
<br>
RIKER: I'm glad to hear it. <br>
SOREN: I'm afraid you're not rid of me yet, Commander. I will be able
to complete the mission. <br>
RIKER: Glad you feel better. <br>
SOREN: What happened? What made the shuttle go into a spin? <br>
RIKER: The port nacelle must have nipped one of the protrusions from
the null pocket and shut it down. <br>
SOREN: Are we still on schedule, then? <br>
RIKER: That depends on how you're doing. <br>
SOREN: I'm fine. We should go check the port engine. <br>
RIKER: Whoa. Maybe we should get the doctor's opinion first. <br>
SOREN: Doctor? <br>
CRUSHER: I don't see any problem. But if you feel any symptoms,
headache, dizziness, come back. <br>

least in regards to one of us. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: The portable transporter array is in. When
we get into null space, we'll need to initialise it before we can
transport the J'naii crew to this shuttle. But there should still be
enough power left to beam all of us back to the Enterprise. <br>
SOREN: Is the buffer field generator installed? <br>
RIKER: Not yet. Geordi thinks that'll be ready by oh eight hundred
hours tomorrow. But before that, we should see if we can balance this

SOREN: There. <br>
RIKER: Set the arc at six point three. I'll optimise the plasma flow. <br>
SOREN: Commander, I'd like to tell you something. Something that's not
easy to say. <br>
RIKER: What's that? <br>
SOREN: I find you attractive. I'm taking a terrible risk telling you
that. It means revealing something to you, something that, if it were
known on my planet, would be very dangerous for me. Occasionally, among
my people, there are a few who are born different, who are throwbacks
from the era when we all had gender. Some have strong inclinations to
maleness, and some have urges to be female. I am one of the latter. <br>
RIKER: I have to admit I had a feeling you were different. <br>
SOREN: I was hoping you would. But in front of Krite and the others, I
must be careful not to reveal myself. <br>
RIKER: Why? <br>
SOREN: On our world these feelings are forbidden. Those who are
discovered are shamed and ridiculed, and only by undergoing
psychotectic therapy and having all elements of gender eliminated can
they become accepted into society again. Those of us who have these
urges live secret and guarded lives. We seek each other out, always
hiding, always terrified of being discovered. <br>
RIKER: How long have you known that you were like this? <br>
SOREN: I've known I was different all my life. But I didn't understand
how or why until I was older. <br>
RIKER: And when you realised, what then? <br>
SOREN: I remember when I was very young, before I knew what I was,
there was a rumour in my school that one of the students preferred a
gender, in that case, male. The children started making fun of him, and
every day they were more cruel They could tell he was afraid and
somehow that seemed to encourage them. One morning in class, he
appeared, bleeding and in ripped clothes. He said he had fallen down.
And of course the school authorities found out and took him away, and
gave him psychotectic treatments. When he came back, he stood in front
of the whole school and told us how happy he was now that he had been
cured. After that, I realised how dangerous it was to be different. And
once I got older, and knew what I was, I was terrified. I have had to
live with that fear ever since. <br>
RIKER: Do you have relationships with others? <br>
SOREN: Yes, with those who have discovered they are male. I have had to
live a life of pretence and lies, but with you I can be honest. Please,
don't say anything. Just think about it.

LAFORGE: Lets just say you don't want to waste any time once you get in

functions, and then I need to breathe a little. <br>
SOREN: I would think you had attended so many affairs like this that it
would become second nature to you. <br>
RIKER: I was raised outdoors. I'm never been very comfortable in
crowded rooms. <br>
SOREN: What do you think of our planet? Isn't it beautiful? <br>
RIKER: Yes, it is. It's beautiful. <br>
SOREN: We have many varieties of plant life. Perhaps you would like to
inspect some of them? <br>
RIKER: Yes, I would. I've always been interested in exobotany. <br>
SOREN: Please, let me take you on a tour. <br>
RIKER: Thank you. It's kind of you. <br>

The leaves first turn pure white, and then blue, when the weather gets
cold. This is called a falla bush. It produces a fragrant flower on

the doorbell rings) <br>
TROI: Come in. Hello, Will. <br>
RIKER: What's all this? <br>
TROI: Wonderful things. My mother sent me a box that belonged to one of
my father's ancestors. It was stored on Earth and just recently turned
up. <br>
RIKER: Do you know who any of these people are? <br>
TROI: No. Some of the pictures have names on, but most of them don't. I
look at these faces and I wonder who they are and if they could be
related to me. <br>
RIKER: This one looks like you. (a cuddly toy) Deanna, I have something
on my mind. I had to see you. <br>
TROI: Has something happened? <br>
RIKER: I've met someone. Someone who's becoming important to me. <br>
TROI: Soren. <br>
RIKER: Yes. You're my friend. I thought, I don't know, I thought I
should tell you. <br>
TROI: I'm glad you did. <br>
RIKER: Nothing will change between us, will it? <br>
TROI: Of course it will. All relationships are constantly changing. But
we'll still be friends, maybe better friends. You're a part of my life,
and I'm a part of yours. That much will always be true. <br>

KRITE: I know. <br>
RIKER: We had an appointment. We were going to discuss <br>
KRITE: I don't think so, Commander. <br>
RIKER: Excuse me? <br>
KRITE: We know about the two of you. We know what you're doing. <br>
RIKER: Where is Soren? <br>
KRITE: We're going to make sure it doesn't happen again. <br>
RIKER: Answer me. Where is Soren? <br>
KRITE: In custody, and there's nothing you can do about it. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOOR: You are aware of the charges against you? <br>
SOREN: Yes. <br>
NOOR: Do you intend to dispute them? Well? What is your response? <br>
(Riker enters) <br>
NOOR: Commander Riker, these proceedings are closed to everyone. <br>
RIKER: I think I just opened them. <br>
NOOR: Sir, this is a private matter. We are grateful for your recent
help, but that gives you no right to interfere with our personal
concerns. <br>
RIKER: I want you to know what really happened. It's all my fault. I
was attracted to Soren. I pursued. I insisted. I didn't understand your
ways until she explained them to me and rejected me. Nothing happened
between us. I ask your forgiveness. I behaved inappropriately. <br>
NOOR: Is this true? <br>
SOREN: No. <br>
RIKER: Soren. <br>
SOREN: I am tired of lies. I am female. I was born that way. I have had
those feelings, those longings, all of my life. It is not unnatural. I
am not sick because I feel this way. I do not need to be helped. I do
not need to be cured. What I need, and what all of those who are like
me need, is your understanding and your compassion. We have not injured
you in any way. And yet, we are scorned and attacked. And all because
we are different. What we do is no different from what you do. We talk
and laugh. We complain about work and we wonder about growing old. We
talk about our families, and we worry about the future. And we cry with
each other when things seem hopeless. All of the loving things that you
do with each other, that is what we do. And for that we are called
misfits and deviants and criminals. What right do you have to punish
us? What right do you have to change us? What makes you think you can
dictate how people love each other? <br>
NOOR: I congratulate you, Soren. Your decision to admit your perversion
makes it much more likely that we can help you. <br>
RIKER: Wait, wait, wait. You don't have to do this. <br>
NOOR: Commander? <br>
RIKER: Let me take her with me. She can go back to the Enterprise. We
would give her asylum. You would never have to see her again. That
would solve the problem, wouldn't it? You'd be rid of her. She would
never be able to influence anyone again. <br>
NOOR: Commander, after Soren's diatribe, you must think that we are a
cruel, repressive people. Nothing could be further from the truth. <br>
RIKER: I'm just trying to find a solution that would satisfy everyone. <br>
NOOR: We are concerned about our citizens. We take our obligations to
them seriously. Soren is sick, and sick people want to get well. <br>
RIKER: Did it occur to you that she might like to stay the way she is? <br>
NOOR: You don't understand. We have a very high success rate in
treating deviants like this. And without exception, they become happier
people after their treatment, and grateful that we care enough to cure
them. You see, Commander, on this world, everyone wants to be normal. <br>
RIKER: She is. <br>
NOOR: Take Soren to quarters. Treatment will begin tomorrow. <br>
RIKER: Don't do this. Soren! <br>
NOOR: No more, Commander. <br>
RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. One to transport.

her these psychotectic treatments. I don't know what to do. <br>
PICARD: Well, I could talk to Noor. Perhaps there's a way to work
something out. <br>
RIKER: Sir, their minds are set. They don't want to hear another
alternative. <br>
PICARD: Then I'm not sure that there's much that we can do. <br>
RIKER: There has to be. My relationship with Soren is not trivial.
She's very important to me. It's my fault that this happened. I have to
help her. <br>
PICARD: Will, if you've come here for sanction to take matters into
your own hands, I can't give it to you. <br>
RIKER: I know that, but I have to do something. <br>
PICARD: Interfering in the internal matters of the J'naii is prohibited
by the Prime Directive. <br>
RIKER: I'm aware of that. <br>
PICARD: If you violate it, you may jeopardising your career. Starfleet
doesn't take these matters lightly, Will. I can't defend you if you go
too far. Do you understand that? <br>

beginning. <br>
RIKER: What? <br>
SOREN: That I was sick. I had these terrible urges, and that is why I
reached out to you. But it was wrong, and I see that now.
I do not understand how I could have done what I did. <br>
