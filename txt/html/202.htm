Captain's log, stardate 45047.2. The Enterprise is en route to the
uninhabited El-Adrel system, its location is near the territory
occupied by an enigmatic race known as The Children of Tama.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Apparently the Tamarians apparently at
El-Adrel Four nearly three weeks ago. They have been transmitting a
subspace signal towards Federation space ever since. <br>
DATA: The signal is a standard mathematical progression. It does not
carry a specific message. <br>
RIKER: But they wanted us to know they were there. <br>
PICARD: Apparently so, Number One. Starfleet believes that their
presence is an attempt at communication. Commander. <br>
DATA: Federation vessels have encountered Tamarian ships seven times
over the past one hundred years. Each meeting went without incident,
however formal relations were not established because communication was
not possible. <br>
RIKER: Why? <br>
DATA: The Children of Tama were called incomprehensible by Captain
Silvestri of the Shiku Maru. Other accounts were comparable. <br>
WORF: A cause for concern. For all we know, they could be threatening
our border. <br>
TROI: Everything in the previous encounters suggests a peaceable race.
We have to start from there. <br>
PICARD: Agreed. I appreciate your prudence, Mister Worf, but Starfleet
believes that the Tamarians have extended a hand. We must do the same. <br>
RIKER: The Children of Tama. I've heard rumours about them for years. <br>
PICARD: Indeed. Are they truly incomprehensible? In my experience,
communication is a matter of patience, imagination. I would like to
believe these are qualities we have in sufficient measure.

PICARD: Mister Data? <br>
DATA: The Tamarian seems to be stating the proper names of individuals
and locations. <br>
PICARD: Yes, but what does it all mean? <br>
DATA: I am at a loss, sir. <br>
PICARD: Captain, would you be prepared to consider the creation of a
mutual non-aggression pact between our two peoples, possibly leading to
a trade agreement and cultural interchange. Does this sound like a
reasonable course of action to you? <br>

DATA: The Tamarians have transported Captain Picard to the planet
surface along with their own captain. <br>
RIKER: Riker to O'Brien. <br>
DATA: It will not be possible to transport, sir. The Tamarian ship has
created a particle scattering field on the planet's ionosphere. <br>
RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. Captain, do you read me? Can we
compensate? <br>
DATA: No, sir. The Tamarians are projecting a particle sustaining beam
into the upper atmosphere. The result is a hyperionisation that
virtually disrupts all EM and subspace carriers. <br>
RIKER: Then they can't communicate with their man either. They won't be
able to beam anyone through the field. <br>
DATA: That is correct. However, they have left sensor frequencies
clear. <br>
RIKER: Then they'll be able to tell what's going on. Analysis, Mister
Worf. What the hell is going on? <br>
WORF: A contest, perhaps. Between champions. Our captain against
theirs. <br>

down to the planet, bring back the captain. <br>
WORF: Aye, Commander. <br>

RIKER: I'm aware of that. But disrupting our transporter beam and
firing on a shuttle are two entirely different things. I'm betting
they're not going to push it that far.

WORF: I do not believe so. I have confidence in his ability as a
warrior. He will be victorious. <br>

can't be certain of that. <br>
RIKER: Agreed. We're only making educated guesses about their
motivations, no more than that. <br>
WORF: Then why do we wait? If we attack the ship now, they will not be
able to maintain their scattering field. <br>
RIKER: Which might start a shooting match, and for all we know, a war,
and we still might not be able to save the captain. <br>
WORF: It would end this stalemate. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First Officer's log, stardate 45048.8. Our attempt
to transport Captain Picard back to the ship has failed. My options are
narrowing and my patience is all but gone.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Observation lounge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Here's the situation on El-Adrel. The entity
has moved off several hundred metres. <br>
CRUSHER: Captain Picard's bioscan readings are stable. The Tamarian's
are not. <br>
TROI: He may be injured. <br>
RIKER: If the entity decides to attack again, the Captain may be facing
it alone. <br>
LAFORGE: The transporter's out of the question. The Tamarian ship has
deepened the scattering field to the D region of the ionosphere.
There's no getting through. <br>
WORF: Unless we attack the ship itself. <br>
RIKER: Are you able to pinpoint the source of their particle beam? <br>
LAFORGE: They're using a polarity coil generator located aft of their
warp drive. It's pretty heavily shielded. <br>
RIKER: Could we get through with our phasers? <br>
LAFORGE: Not with the first spread. It'd take a couple of hits. <br>
RIKER: That's not good enough. We need to knock out the scattering
field in one shot and have the Captain back on the Enterprise before
they know what happened. <br>
LAFORGE: If we selectively target the amplification pathways around the
generator, it should be just as effective. And we can do it in one
burst. <br>
RIKER: How long will it take to set up? <br>
LAFORGE: Worf and I would have to adjust the pre-fire chamber. That'll
give us the focus we need. A few hours? <br>
RIKER: Make it so. <br>
(Geordi and Worf leave) <br>
RIKER: I would prefer to find a peaceful solution. If we could talk our
way out of this one, that much the better. <br>
TROI: Unfortunately, it may not be that simple. <br>
RIKER: What did you find out? <br>
DATA: The Tamarian ego structure does not seem to allow what we
normally think of as self-identity. Their ability to abstract is highly
unusual. They seem to communicate through narrative imagery by
reference to the individuals and places which appear in their
mytho-historical accounts. <br>
TROI: It's as if I were to say to you, Juliet on her balcony. <br>
CRUSHER: An image of romance. <br>
TROI: Exactly. Imagery is everything to the Tamarians. It embodies
their emotional states, their very thought processes. It's how they
communicate, and it's how they think. <br>
RIKER: If we know how they think, shouldn't we be able to get something
across to them? <br>
DATA: No, sir. The situation is analogous to understanding the grammar
of a language but none of the vocabulary. <br>
CRUSHER: If I didn't know who Juliet was or what she was doing on that
balcony, the image alone wouldn't have any meaning. <br>
TROI: That's correct. For instance, we know that Darmok was a great
hero, a hunter, and that Tanagra was an island, but that's it. Without
the details, there's no understanding. <br>
DATA: It is necessary for us to learn the narrative from which the
Tamarians drawing their imagery. Given our current relations, that does
not appear likely.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(night has fallen, a fire is lit and Dathon is
lying down) <br>
DATHON: Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra. <br>
PICARD: Our situation is similar to theirs. I understand that. But I
need to know more. You must tell me more about Darmok and Jalad. Tell
me. You used the words, 'Temba, his arms wide' when you gave me the
knife and the fire. Could that mean give? Temba, his arms wide. Darmok.
Give me more about Darmok. <br>
DATHON: Darmok on the ocean. <br>
PICARD: Darmok. (draws on the soil) The ocean. Darmok on the ocean. A
metaphor? For being alone? Isolated? Darmok on the ocean. <br>
(Dathon writhes in pain) <br>
PICARD: Are you alright? <br>
DATHON: Kiazi's children, their faces wet. <br>
PICARD: Temba, his arms open. Give me more about Darmok on the ocean. <br>
DATHON: Tanagra on the ocean. Darmok at Tanagra. <br>
PICARD: At Tanagra. A country? Tanagra on the ocean. An island. Temba,
his arms wide. <br>
DATHON: Jalad on the ocean. Jalad at Tanagra. <br>
PICARD: Jalad at Tanagra. He went to the same island as Darmok. Darmok
and Jalad Tanagra. <br>
DATHON: The beast at Tanagra. <br>
PICARD: The beast? There was a creature at Tanagra? Darmok and Jalad,
the beast of Tanagra. They arrived separately. They struggled together
against a common foe, the beast at Tanagra. Darmok and Jalad at
Tanagra. <br>
DATHON: Darmok and Jalad on the ocean. <br>
PICARD: They left together. Darmok and Jalad on the ocean. <br>
DATHON: The ocean. (another spasm) Zinda! His face black, his eyes red.
Callimas at Bahar. <br>
PICARD: You hoped this would happen, didn't you? You knew there was a
dangerous creature on this planet and you knew from the tale of Darmok
that a danger shared might sometimes bring two people together. Darmok
and Jalad at Tanagra. You and me, here, at El-Adrel. <br>
DATHON: Kira at Bashi. Temba, his arms wide. <br>
PICARD: My turn? No, I'm not much of a story teller. Besides, you
wouldn't understand. Shaka. when the walls fell. Perhaps that doesn't
matter. You want to hear it anyway. There's a story, a very ancient
one, from Earth. I'll try and remember it. Gilgamesh, a king.
Gilgamesh, a king, at Uruk. He tormented his subjects. He made them
angry. They cried out aloud, send us a companion for our king. Spare us
from his madness. Enkidu, a wild man from the forest, entered the city.
They fought in the temple. They fought in the street. Gilgamesh
defeated Enkidu. They became great friends. Gilgamesh and Enkidu at
Uruk. <br>
DATHON: At Uruk. <br>
PICARD: The new friends went out into the desert together, where the
great bull of heaven was killing men by the hundreds. Enkidu caught the
bull by the tail. Gilgamesh struck it with his sword. <br>
DATHON: Gilgamesh. <br>
PICARD: They were victorious. But Enkidu fell to the ground, struck
down by the gods. And Gilgamesh wept bitter tears, saying, 'he who was
my companion through adventure and hardship, is gone forever. <br>
(and so Dathon dies)

RIKER: For the next time we encounter the Tamarians? <br>

to theirs. The Tamarian was willing to risk all of us just for the hope
of communication, connection. Now the door is open between our peoples.
That commitment meant more to him than his own life. Thank you, Number
One. </font> </p>
