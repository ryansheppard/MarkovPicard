RIKER: Fletcher has more experience with propulsion systems. <br>
TROI: But Carstairs is better with people. Considering this is a
supervisory position, I'd go with her. <br>
RIKER: I guess you're right. Didn't we just do crew evaluation reports?
<br>
TROI: Three months ago. <br>
RIKER: It seems like three weeks. Why don't we just give everybody a
promotion and call it a night, Commander? <br>
TROI: Fine with me, Captain. <br>
RIKER: Could we have two coffees, please. <br>
(at another table, four young people hear Troi's laughter) <br>
LAVELLE: (red uniform) What could be so funny? What's so funny about
crew evaluations? <br>
OGAWA: Don't worry about it, Sam. <br>
SITO: (gold, Bajoran) Can't we just try and have a good time here? <br>
LAVELLE: How can I have a good time when my career's being decided
across the room? Come on. Think promotion. Promotion. Promotion. <br>
TAURIK: (a vulcan) You can't really believe that what you are doing
will influence the outcome of your evaluation. <br>
(actually, he will become Vaurik of Voyager) <br>
LAVELLE: Promotion. Promotion. Promotion. <br>
OGAWA: It's a time-honoured strategy, Taurik. <br>
SITO: The Vedeks of the Janalan order maintain a round the clock chant
for the benefit of the Bajoran people. <br>
TAURIK: Considering the history of your planet, that doesn't exactly
validate what he's doing. <br>
LAVELLE: Promote me, please, so I can make Lieutenant and have my own
room. <br>
TAURIK: If you're unhappy sharing quarters with me, then you should put
in for a new room assignment. Just in case you're not promoted. <br>
(the waiter brings coffee) <br>
RIKER: I've been thinking about who to promote to Ops. <br>
TROI: The new night duty officer? <br>
RIKER: Lavelle is an obvious candidate, but I'm also considering Ensign
Sito. <br>
TROI: Thank you. <br>
BEN: You're welcome. Are you sure about dessert? <br>
TROI: Yes. Don't tempt me. <br>

RIKER: Next time, try letting the locking relay float until the actual

PICARD: Helm, change course for the Argaya system, maximum warp. <br>

in the Observation lounge. Mister Data, Mister Worf. <br>
RIKER: Ensign Sito, take over at Ops. <br>
SITO: Yes, sir. <br>
(Riker, Data, Worf and Picard leave) <br>
SITO: The Argaya system's close to the Cardassian border. I wonder why
we're going there. How'd you like to be a spider under that table? <br>
LAVELLE: What? <br>
SITO: A spider under the table. <br>
LAVELLE: Is that like a fly on the wall? <br>
SITO: I guess so. You did really well during the drill. <br>
LAVELLE: Well apparently Commander Riker didn't think so. I swear he's
got it in for me. <br>

LAFORGE: Sure, Taurik. What is it? <br>
TAURIK: I'd like you to take a look at something. <br>
LAFORGE: Have you been improvising again, Ensign? <br>
TAURIK: In a manner of speaking. I'm running a computer simulation to
test a new warp field configuration. <br>
LAFORGE: You've got a problem here. Your plasma flow to the nacelles is
out of sync. <br>
TAURIK: Actually, sir, that was done deliberately. As you can see, this
configuration has increased overall warp field integrity by seven
percent. <br>
LAFORGE: You're right. <br>
TAURIK: Doctor Nils Diaz has been experimenting with this technique at
the Tanaline Propulsion Laboratory. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, I'm familiar with his work, but I never heard anything
about this. <br>
TAURIK: His findings have not been released yet. I was able to review a
preliminary report when I was at the Academy. <br>
LAFORGE: I look forward to reading about it <br>
TAURIK: I predict that when these findings are made public, they will
become a new model for warp field operation. <br>
LAFORGE: Sounds interesting. <br>
TAURIK: With your permission, sir, I'd like to begin tests to see if
the technique can be adapted to our warp drive. <br>
LAFORGE: There might be variables that you didn't account for. <br>
TAURIK: I was quite thorough. <br>
LAFORGE: I'm sure you were, but I'd still need to see your simulation
before I authorise any tests. <br>
TAURIK: As you wish. <br>
LAFORGE: If you have any other ideas for increasing efficiency, don't
hesitate to run them by me. <br>

CRUSHER: In fact, I'm recommending you for a promotion. How does
Lieutenant Alyssa Ogawa sound? <br>
OGAWA: It sounds wonderful. <br>
CRUSHER: I'll talk to Commander Riker and I'm sure it'll be official as
soon as the current crew evaluations are over. Oh, Alyssa, how are
things going between you and Lieutenant Powell? <br>
OGAWA: Fine. I think. <br>
CRUSHER: You think? <br>
OGAWA: I'm sure it's nothing, but he seems preoccupied lately. Last
night he had to cancel our date. <br>
CRUSHER: I see. <br>
OGAWA: He's been putting together a research proposal. He's been really
busy with it. <br>
CRUSHER: I know what that's like. Sometimes I get so busy with research
I forget to eat. <br>
OGAWA: I just wonder. <br>
CRUSHER: What? Sit down. <br>
OGAWA: I've never met anyone like Andrew. It's as though we've known
each other forever. <br>
CRUSHER: You do seem very well suited. <br>
OGAWA: But I know that in the beginning of a romance it's possible to
be a little blind. <br>
CRUSHER: I'm not sure I know what you mean. <br>
OGAWA: Well, cancelling a date like that, the way he's been so distant
lately. Doctor, do you think those could be warning signs that he's
losing interest? <br>
CRUSHER: Alyssa, I think you're overreacting. <br>
OGAWA: Maybe so. <br>
CRUSHER: If I cared as much about someone as much as you care about
Andrew, he'd have to do a lot more than cancel a date before I'd get
suspicious. <br>
OGAWA: You're right. <br>
CRUSHER: I'm sure that when this research is over, things will be back
just the way they were. <br>

Ogawa. </font></p>

main deflector dish, recalibrate the navigation grid, and use internal

something like that again? <br>

me is that you participated in a
cover-up that impeded an official investigation into the death of a
cadet. <br>
SITO: Sir, I know I should have told the truth right from the start <br>
PICARD: Yes you should, but you didn't. Instead you joined with the
others to pretended that was simply an accident. Now, what do you think
that tells me about your character? <br>
SITO: Sir, if you had any idea what it was like after that incident. I
didn't have any friends. I didn't have anyone to talk to. I had to take
my flight test with the instructor because no one else would be my
partner. In a lot of ways it would have been easier to just walk away,
but I didn't. I stuck with it. Doesn't that say something about my
character, too? <br>

LAFORGE: We're evaluating hull resiliency. Starfleet requires periodic
testing. <br>

doesn't matter whether he likes you as long as he respects you. <br>
SITO: He must, otherwise he would not be considering you for the Ops

LAVELLE: You're probably right. Maybe I'm just telling myself he hates
me so that if I don't get promoted, I'll have an excuse. <br>

RIKER: I happen to like poker. <br>
TROI: But your senior officers might have thought you were trying to
ingratiate yourself. I guess it's lucky that they realised you were
young and inexperienced, and decided not to hold it against you. <br>

the technique I was using was actually more efficient, he seemed
annoyed. <br>

LAVELLE: He didn't like the fact that you knew something he didn't. <br>

SITO: Yes, sir. <br>
WORF: I also teach an advanced class. I believe you may be ready to
participate. However, before you can join the group, you must pass the
gik'tal. <br>
SITO: Gik'tal? <br>
WORF: Yes. It is a very ancient Klingon ritual. It tests your knowledge
of the forms of the mok'bara. <br>
SITO: I should practice first. <br>
WORF: No. No practise. That is part of the ritual. The test must be
unannounced. <br>
(Worf blindfolds her) <br>

WORF: Are you listening, Ensign? <br>
SITO: Yes, but <br>
WORF: Defend yourself. <br>
(and a third time) <br>
WORF: You did not anticipate. <br>
(Sito removes the blindfold) <br>
SITO: How am I supposed to defend myself when I can't see a thing? <br>
WORF: Stop making excuses. Replace the blindfold. <br>
SITO: No. It's not a fair test. <br>
WORF: Very good, Ensign. You have passed the challenge. <br>
SITO: What? By taking off the blindfold? <br>
WORF: It takes courage to say the test is unfair. <br>
SITO: One thing I don't understand. Doesn't gik'tal mean to the death? <br>
WORF: You speak Klingon. <br>
SITO: Sir, is there really such a thing as a gik'tal challenge? <br>
WORF: No, there is not. But perhaps next time you are judged unfairly,
it will not take so many bruises for you protest.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Ready room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SITO: All I've ever wanted is to make a career for
myself in Starfleet. I can't change what happened at the Academy. No
one can. All I can do is work hard and try to earn the respect of the
people I serve with. If you're not going to give me that chance, then I
respectfully request that you transfer me to another ship. <br>
PICARD: If you're looking for a more lenient commander, I don't think
you'll find one. <br>
SITO: Permission to speak freely, sir? <br>
PICARD: Please do. <br>
SITO: If you didn't want me on your ship you should have said so when I
was assigned to it. It's not your place to punish me for what I did at
the Academy. I've worked hard here. My record is exemplary. If you're
going to judge me, judge me for what I am now. <br>
PICARD: Very well, Ensign. I will. It took courage to come here and
face me after what I said to you the other day. I didn't ask you here
because I was assessing your qualifications for the Ops position. <br>
SITO: I don't understand, sir. <br>
PICARD: I was harsh with you because I wanted to assess you for a very
important mission. A mission that could put you in a situation that
would be far more unnerving than a dressing-down by your commanding
officer. <br>
SITO: Can I ask what that mission is, sir? <br>
PICARD: Join the senior officers in the Observation lounge at oh nine
hundred hours. We'll discuss it then. <br>
SITO: Yes, sir. <br>
PICARD: And, Ensign. I do know why you ended up on the Enterprise. I
asked for you. I wanted to make sure that you got a fair chance to
redeem yourself. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Please, take a seat, Ensign. <br>
(then she sees the Cardassian) <br>
PICARD: This is Joret Dal. He was in the escape pod that we retrieved.
He is a member of the Cardassian military, and a Federation operative.
He has risked his life to bring us invaluable information about
Cardassian strategic intentions. Information that could very well
enhance the security of Bajor, as well as other planets in this sector.
Now, it is absolutely imperative that we return him safely back to
Cardassian space. <br>
JORET: It will not be easy. The border is heavily guarded. <br>
RIKER: As his ship was destroyed, he'll be using one of our shuttles. <br>
JORET: If a patrol stops me, I will claim to have stolen it. <br>
WORF: We have distressed the shuttle so that it appears to have been
fired upon. <br>
RIKER: Joret will attempt to talk his way past the patrol. <br>
JORET: If I were alone, the chances of my succeeding would be slim. But
if I had a prisoner with me, a Bajoran terrorist, I would appear to be
a bounty hunter. Border crossings of that nature are not uncommon, and
for a price the patrol can be convinced to look the other way. <br>
PICARD: Once the shuttle is safely past the patrol, Joret will put you
into an escape pod and return you back across the border. <br>
RIKER: Since the pod is so small, it will be difficult to detect. <br>
PICARD: We'll be waiting here to pick you up. <br>
SITO: I understand, sir. <br>
PICARD: Ensign, this is obviously a very dangerous mission. I'm not
ordering you to take part in it. <br>
SITO: Then I volunteer, sir. <br>
WORF: Be certain you understand the risk you are taking. If you are
captured <br>
SITO: I'm Bajoran. No one knows better than I do what Cardassians do to
their prisoners. I've made my decision. <br>
PICARD: Very well, Ensign. Will you report to Sickbay. Doctor Crusher
will explain. And Ensign Sito, I must ask you not to discuss this
mission with anyone. <br>
SITO: Yes, sir. <br>

look like Joret had mistreated me. <br>

long before we're detected by the patrol ships. <br>
SITO: When they stop us, do you want me to say anything? <br>
JORET: No. It should seem that I've broken your will. If you're asked
any questions, look at me as though you're afraid to answer. <br>
SITO: Can I ask you something? Why are you doing this, risking your
life to help Starfleet? <br>
JORET: I don't consider myself a traitor, if that's what you're asking.
All my life I've served in the military. Once it was an institution
dedicated to the security of Cardassia, now it's little more than a
platform for ambitious Guls hoping to make their reputations in battle.
If the information I provided helps Starfleet deter even one pointless
skirmish, I've served my purpose. I'm sick of war. My people need
peace. <br>
SITO: I never thought I'd hear a Cardassian say something like that. <br>
JORET: And I never thought a Bajoran would risk her life to help a
Cardassian get home. <br>
