I didn't warn you. <br>
WORF: Pah! <br>
TROI: I fold. <br>
DATA: I will raise you three. <br>
RIKER: No cards? The best poker face I've ever seen. Dealer takes two.
Your three and ten more. <br>
DATA: I will see your ten, and raise you twenty. <br>
RIKER: Data, Have you got a flush or a full house? <br>
DATA: It will cost you twenty to make that determination, sir. <br>
RIKER: Dealer folds. <br>
TROI: You two have successfully divided the evening between you. <br>
WORF: I suspect conspiracy. Far be it for me to accuse my superior
officers. <br>
RIKER: You're getting harder and harder to bluff, Data. You've learned
this game very well. <br>
DATA: Yes sir, I believe I have. <br>
RIKER: Tell you what. I'll bet that I can find any card that you hide
in this deck. And furthermore, I will make you help me find it. <br>
TROI: Careful, Data. <br>
DATA: Your guidance is much valued, Counsellor. However. <br>
RIKER: Pick a card. Don't let me see it. (Jack of hearts) Now lose it
in the deck. Cut the deck into two even piles. <br>
(Riker removes one pile) <br>
RIKER: Okay. Once more time. And again. How many cards? <br>
DATA: Eleven. <br>
RIKER: Take five. Throw them away. <br>
(He does, literally, over his shoulder) <br>
RIKER: Pick three more. Okay, now pick one of those. Is that your card?
<br>
(Yes, it is.) <br>
TROI: Incredible. <br>
DATA: Not at all, Counsellor. You surreptitiously placed the edge of
your left thumb against the card. When you divided the deck to
reshuffle, you kept that card on top. You thus were able to have me
either save or discard, depending on the location of the card, which
you followed at each step until we were left with just one. The card I
originally chose. Sir, I believe under the circumstances <br>

their government fell apart. <br>

destroyed. Sensors show that the colonists now live in structures that
extend nearly three kilometres beneath the city. <br>

O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. Three hundred metres beyond the colony perimeter. <br>
WORF: Sir, we can anticipate a violent response to our presence.
Perhaps the Doctor should wait here until we signal. <br>
CRUSHER: I appreciate your concern. I think it's exaggerated. <br>
WORF: The colony is completely lawless. Lieutenant Yar spoke of rape
gangs and <br>

The escape pod was apparently moved into the tunnels ahead of us. <br>

what they are doing) <br>

PASSER-BY: Pardon me. <br>
CRUSHER: Maybe things have changed here. <br>
(Then an alarm goes off, and an armed group appears) <br>
MAN: Freeze! Identify yourselves. <br>
RIKER: We're from the Federation Starship Enterprise. We tracked two of
our crewmen to this area. Do you know anything about them? <br>
MAN: Possibly. <br>
RIKER: What do you mean? <br>

HAYNE: The Alliance is holding your men hostage, Commander Riker, not
us. You can expect a ransom demand. <br>
RIKER: The Alliance? <br>
HAYNE: Our good friends. Our good friends are going to be upset when
they realise we took their last crate of Telluridan synth-ale. <br>
RIKER: Maybe I should take this to the authorities. <br>
HAYNE: We are the authorities. The Coalition, our cadre, runs this side
of the city. The Alliance controls the other side. Take your choice. <br>
RIKER: Are you offering to help us? <br>
HAYNE: In return for some consideration. Phasers are in short supply
down here. A starship isn't going to miss a few. <br>
WORF: That is no better than a ransom demand. <br>
HAYNE: No matter what you give the Alliance, they'll eventually kill
your crewmen anyway. With our help, at least there's a chance you'll
get your men back alive. All I'm asking for is help in maintaining our
defence. We are trying to keep the peace. <br>
RIKER: Everything we've seen would indicate otherwise. <br>
HAYNE: A prank. The proximity implants prevent either side from doing
any serious damage. They warn us when an enemy is approaching. <br>
WORF: Then why do you need more phasers? <br>
HAYNE: The Alliance just discovered a large cache of weapons. I'm just
trying to make things even, to preserve the peace. <br>
CRUSHER: You keep using the word peace. We've heard a different version
of life on Turkana Four. <br>
HAYNE: Ancient history. Where did you hear that? <br>
DATA: A former crewman was born here. <br>
HAYNE: Where's he now? <br>
DATA: She was killed in the line of duty. <br>
HAYNE: That's as good a way to die as any. As I said, ancient history.
This is now, and your men are in trouble. <br>
RIKER: We'll return to the Enterprise and consider your proposal. <br>
HAYNE: A gift for your Captain. <br>

Alliance raid each other for supplies, much of it non-essential. <br>
PICARD: Why? <br>
WORF: A battle exercise. <br>
RIKER: Their defences apparently prevent deep strikes into each other's
territory. Minor skirmishes are all that's left. <br>
PICARD: Coalition. Alliance. It all sounds so reasonable, but what
you've described is the behaviour of urban street thugs. We certainly
won't trade weapons for crewmen. How do you suggest we deal with them? <br>
RIKER: We have to tell them something. <br>
WORF: No promises, no denials. <br>
PICARD: For now, Hayne's Coalition is our only safe access to the
colony. We'll keep the door open, see where it leads us. <br>

HAYNE [on viewscreen]: Hello, Enterprise. Commander Riker, would you
introduce me to your Captain? <br>
PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard. <br>
HAYNE [on viewscreen]: I have someone here you might like to meet. This
is Ishara. Ishara Yar. <br>
ISHARA [on viewscreen]: Tasha was my sister. <br>
HAYNE [on viewscreen]: There's an old saying, Captain. The enemy of my
enemy is my friend. I've decided it's in my best interest to help you
get your crewmen back. <br>
PICARD: With nothing from us in return? <br>
HAYNE [on viewscreen]: You could be forced into paying my adversary a
ransom in weapons. I'll do anything I can to avoid that possibility. <br>
PICARD: What do you propose? <br>
HAYNE [on viewscreen]: Ishara will be our liaison. <br>
ISHARA [on viewscreen]: I know Alliance territory. I can help you with
a rescue plan. <br>
PICARD: One moment. <br>
WORF: Mute. <br>
PICARD: Reactions? <br>
WORF: I do not trust him. <br>
RIKER: She could be a fake. We told him a member of our crew was from
the colony. <br>
CRUSHER: All Hayne had to do was search through their database had on
Starfleet to come up with Tasha's name. <br>
PICARD: Counsellor? <br>
TROI: He's deceiving us, and he's clearly hoping to manipulate us. As
for the identity of the young woman, I can't really tell. <br>
PICARD: Neverthe less, this is an option we cannot neglect. We'll
continue on other fronts as they present themselves. For now, let's see
what she has to say. <br>
WORF: Open. <br>
PICARD: I have decided to accept your proposal. <br>

CRUSHER: Yes, I will. <br>
PICARD: Please, sit down. <br>
(Riker offers her his seat) <br>
ISHARA: Thank you. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps it would help if you gave us some idea of what we're
dealing with on Turkana Four. The last information describes a colony
in almost complete disarray. <br>
ISHARA: It started falling apart almost thirty years ago. There were
dozens of factions. They fought until the city above ground was in
ruins. <br>
RIKER: The Coalition and the Alliance are all that's left? <br>
ISHARA: We were the two strongest factions. When the government
couldn't stop the violence, they gave us police powers. The proximity
detectors were originally designed by the government to keep us under
control. <br>
PICARD: Apparently, that part of the plan didn't work very well. <br>
ISHARA: No. After a few months, we didn't need the government any more.
<br>
LAFORGE: Tasha left you in the middle of all that? <br>
ISHARA: She didn't abandon me, if that's what you mean. Tasha asked me
to go with her, but I had already joined the Coalition. They were my
family. Captain, we don't have a lot of time. Maybe we should get
started. <br>
WORF [OC]: Incoming transmission from the colony, Captain. <br>
PICARD: On screen. <br>
TAN TSU [on monitor]: Enterprise, I'm being held by Turkana Four
Alliance. I've been instructed to say that you have twenty hours to
make reparations for Federation intrusion into this colony, or my pilot
and I will be killed. <br>
CRUSHER: Ask them if we can at least send some medical <br>
(transmission ends) <br>
ISHARA: Take that threat seriously, Captain. They'll torture them and
then they'll kill them. My cadre has never recovered a hostage alive
from the Alliance. Your crewmen could be held in any number of places.
The Alliance has two main headquarters and thirteen ancillary bases of
operation. All underground, all heavily guarded. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain, if I could get to the myographic scanner. <br>
ISHARA: What's that? <br>
DATA: A sensing device from the escape pod. It monitors the bioelectric
signatures of the crew, in the event they get separated from the pod. <br>
LAFORGE: I could install a booster on the device that would relay its
signals to the Enterprise. Then we could track the men from up here. <br>
PICARD: Unfortunately, we don't know where the escape pod is. <br>
ISHARA: Level three C, section five four seven. We have our sources. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Ishara's data file is up on a monitor. There are a
lot of underground levels) <br>
ISHARA: Access tunnels are here and here. <br>
RIKER: We could transfer the away team right into this intersection. <br>
ISHARA: Don't underestimate them, Commander. They'll be ready for that.
I've seen them use this kind of strategy before.
I know it looks isolated and easily accessible, but my guess is they
have hundreds of men on the levels above and below just waiting for you
to make your move. <br>
WORF: We will need a diversion. <br>
LAFORGE: Transport a couple of photon grenades into the adjoining
chamber. At minimum intensity it wouldn't kill anybody, but it would
shake them up a bit. <br>
RIKER: That won't give us enough time. We need to occupy them long
enough for you to install the relay. <br>
ISHARA: Transport me into this corridor. My magnetic implant will set
off the defence alarms. They'll think it's a raid by the Coalition. <br>
RIKER: Too dangerous. We've seen what those tunnels look like. You
could easily be cut off from the rest of us. Worf, if we <br>
ISHARA: Commander Riker. I was ordered to assist you in any way
possible. That doesn't mean as long as it's safe or convenient. If you
had the time, we could come up with another plan, but you don't. Right
now, I'm your best option. <br>

between sonomic chromosomes, but not enough to affect results. It
should take me a few hours to run the sonomic comparison. <br>

us down on the colony. It was more than I expected. <br>
ISHARA: I don't run away when things get tough, like some people. Like
my sister did. <br>
PICARD: Let me tell you about your sister. The first time I saw Tasha
Yar, she was making her way through a Carnelian mine field to reach a
wounded colonist. Her ship had responded to their distress call, as had
mine. When it was all over, I requested that she be assigned to the
Enterprise. Her ship's captain owed me a favour. In the months that
followed, she never once failed to put the safety of the crew before
her own, and she died doing the same. I'm sorry you never knew the
woman Tasha became. I think you would have been proud of her. And she
of you.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Ishara is in a tight catsuit now, with Data at a
rear science station and looking at her schematic) <br>
DATA: What is this structure? <br>
ISHARA: A main fusion source. There's one next to each of the Alliance
headquarters. It powers all of their defensive systems. This chamber is
accessed from the level below. Entry points are evenly spaced along
this wall every twenty five metres. Data, where was Tasha's post? <br>
DATA: Tactical station. Where Lieutenant Worf is now. <br>
ISHARA: Did Tasha have many friends here? <br>
DATA: Yes. She was especially close to Commander Riker and Lieutenant
Worf. And to myself. <br>
ISHARA: Are you able to have friends? <br>
DATA: Yes. <br>
ISHARA: But you don't have feelings, do you? <br>
DATA: Not as such. However, even among humans, friendship is sometimes
less an emotional response and more a sense of familiarity. <br>
ISHARA: So you can become used to someone? <br>
DATA: Exactly. As I experience certain sensory input patterns, my
mental pathways become accustomed to them. The inputs eventually are
anticipated, and even missed when absent. <br>
ISHARA: Like my sister. <br>
DATA: Yes, like your sister.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: They've been moved so far underground it's
been difficult to pinpoint their signatures. But the men are here, next
to one of the Alliance headquarters. That's about two kilometres of
solid granite above their heads. <br>
RIKER: So much for the transporter. <br>
LAFORGE: Not necessarily. We could use the ship's phasers to cut a
shaft through the bedrock to this storage tunnel here.
With a clear path through the rock, we'd be able to transport through
the tunnel. That would put us close enough to get to the crewmen. But
I'll need two hours to refit the ship's phasers for drilling. <br>
RIKER: It's a real maze down there. <br>
ISHARA: I spent a lot of time in that section before they took it over.
There are blind tunnels and dead ends that don't even show up on this
map. <br>
WORF: We do not have much choice. <br>
ISHARA: If it wasn't for my implant setting off all the alarms, I could
guide you to your men. <br>
DATA: We could remove the implant. <br>
ISHARA: No, it has a micro explosive inside that detonates on contact
with air. When you join a cadre, you join for life. <br>
DATA: A small force field containing xenon or another inert gas could
be placed over the incision site. The explosive could possibly be
disarmed at the same time it is removed. <br>
RIKER: This is something you're going to have to decide for yourself,
Ishara. Think about it while we're waiting for Geordi.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ISHARA: Our parents were killed in some crossfire
just after I was born. Some people took care of us for a few months,
then one day we came home and they were gone. So Tasha took care of me,
and when I was old enough I joined the Coalition. <br>
DATA: And Tasha did not? <br>
ISHARA: My sister hated the cadres. She blamed them for our parents
death. For everything. She refused to join, and she left as soon as she
had the chance. I always thought she was weak for doing that, but maybe
I was wrong. Maybe, maybe she made the right choice. To work together
for something besides killing, to be close to someone without having to
protect your back. Very appealing. You're the perfect example. I hardly
even know you, Data, but already I completely trust you. I even
consider you a friend. <br>
DATA: Thank you. I would like to consider you my friend as well. <br>
ISHARA: If I had known about this place fifteen years ago, things
might've been different. Maybe it's not too late.

apply to the Academy and eventually join Starfleet. <br>
PICARD: Does she understand the magnitude of these decisions? <br>

TROI: I get a sense of ambiguity from her. Her loyalties are clearly
divided, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Are you suggesting we deny her an escape from this environment?
<br>
TROI: No, I'm just not sure she wants to escape. It's the only way of
life she's ever known. <br>

proceed with the mission as planned. <br>
