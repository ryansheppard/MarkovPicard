(Enterprise is near a star which is giving off flares, as Picard makes
a ship-wide announcement) <br>
PICARD [OC]: All hands, this is the Captain. As you may know, the sun
in the Delos system is undergoing large-scale magnetic field changes,
producing violent, gigantic flares. Now, we shall be studying this star
at close range. Even though we shall be running with full deflectors,
the closeness of this event and its severity are going to create
problems.
</font>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Intense magnetic fields have a disruptive
effect on electrical systems. Therefore we can expect communications
interruptions, as well as potential temporary loss of other systems. As
a precaution, we are now going to Yellow Alert. Stay sharp, everyone.

PICARD: Half impulse. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir, one half impulse. <br>
PICARD: On main viewer. Mask out the photosphere. Magnify. Quadrant one

RIKER: I've never seen anything like this before. The violence of these
eruptions is awesome. <br>
DATA: Captain, I'm reading an unusual number of sunspots and eruptive
prominences, sir. The magnetic field is extremely irregular. <br>
WESLEY: Captain, deflectors are being hit by a huge burst of X-rays. <br>
(The science station lights up with blue static and he steps away) <br>
WESLEY: Wow! Look. Captain, my console seems to be overloading. <br>
WORF: The X-ray burst is disrupting systems, Captain. I'm adjusting
deflectors to compensate.

TROI: Captain, the level of tension on the ship is mounting. <br>
PICARD: Understandable. Mister Data? <br>
DATA: If we are to investigate, sir, we must get closer. <br>
PICARD: Mister La Forge, move us in closer. This is the Captain. We
will be pushing the shields to the limit, but we are getting a
splendid view of this phenomenon. <br>
WORF: Captain, I have intercepted what appears to be a distress signal.
<br>
PICARD: Let me hear it. <br>
T'JON [OC]: This is T'Jon. I am on the Ornaran freighter (garbled). We
have a serious problem here. Can't seem to fix it. We need help. <br>
DATA: The transmission is coming from a freighter in orbit around the
fourth planet in the system. However, the receiving station is on the
third planet. <br>
PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. <br>
TASHA: Hailing frequencies open. <br>
PICARD: Unidentified freighter, this is the USS Enterprise. May we be
of assistance? <br>
T'JON [on viewscreen]: (a very poor image) Whoever you are, yes! I'm
having trouble navigating. We can't maintain a steady course. Please
help us if you can. <br>
PICARD: Can't you enhance the frequency? <br>
TASHA: Too much interference. <br>
PICARD: Set course to intersect with the freighter. Warp two. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Maintain Yellow Alert. <br>
T'JON [on viewscreen]: I can't control the helm any longer. I'm losing
orbit. We're heading into the atmosphere. Please, do something. We're
going to burn up. We haven't much time. <br>
WORF: It is a freighter, very old. <br>
DATA: Captain, our sensors are being severely affected by the sun
flares. <br>
PICARD: Helm, take us in as close as possible to the freighter's orbit.
<br>
LAFORGE: Moving in, sir. <br>
DATA: There are six life forms aboard the freighter, sir. <br>
WORF: Captain, the freighter's orbit is decaying. <br>
PICARD: How long before it loses integrity? <br>
WORF: A matter of minutes. <br>
PICARD: Unidentified freighter, this is the USS Enterprise. <br>
T'JON [OC]: Enterprise, this is the Ornaran freighter Sanction. <br>
PICARD: Put this on the main viewer. <br>
TASHA: The visual transmission is still breaking up. <br>
PICARD: Freighter Sanction, this is the Enterprise. What is your
situation? <br>
VOICES [on viewscreen]: Not so good. Helm isn't working right. What is
the problem? <br>
PICARD: This is the Enterprise. With all this interference it is
difficult to copy your transmission. If you all talk at once it is
almost impossible. Now, please say again. What is your situation? <br>
T'JON [on viewscreen]: I am T'Jon, Captain of the Sanction. <br>
PICARD: At last. How can we help? <br>
T'JON [on viewscreen]: We have lost, I don't know, something. I am no
longer able to maintain this orbit, nor am I able to use the main
thrusters. It's all, you know, dead, I guess. It's all shut down? <br>
PICARD: Well, that is a little vague. What is the computer analysis? <br>
T'JON [on viewscreen]: Well, the computer's not working very well. <br>
PICARD: Data, can you tap into their computer and clarify the
situation? <br>
DATA: I will attempt it, sir. <br>
TASHA: Captain, the tractor beam is available, if you want it. <br>
RIKER: At least we can pull them out of orbit before they enter the
atmosphere. <br>
PICARD: Freighter, we're going to lock on the tractor beam and pull you
out of orbit. <br>
T'JON [on viewscreen]: Hey, that's, that's great. <br>
WORF: Captain, the freighter's orbit continues to deteriorate. <br>
TASHA: The solar flares are interfering with the tractor beam, Captain.
I can't lock on. <br>
PICARD: Captain T'Jon, we are unable to attach our tractor beam because
of the intense solar activity. <br>
T'JON [on viewscreen]: I understand. Thanks for trying. <br>
DATA: Sir, I have determined what is malfunctioning on the freighter. <br>
PICARD: Captain, we have analysed your problem. <br>
T'JON [on viewscreen]: Great. <br>
PICARD: Data. <br>
DATA: Your ship's design uses an electromagnetic coil to constrict the
exhaust flow. That coil is misaligned. <br>
T'JON [on viewscreen]: Really? <br>
PICARD: Do you have the necessary tools to realign the coil? <br>
T'JON [on viewscreen]: I don't think so. <br>
LAFORGE: I believe, Captain, we can provide them with a temporary
substitute. Our ship's stores contain a coil of the proper type. <br>
RIKER: Can we beam one over? <br>
TASHA: Yes. <br>
PICARD: Captain, we're beaming over a replacement coil. <br>
T'JON [on viewscreen]: That's great. And that'll fix us up? <br>
PICARD: Yes, once it's installed. <br>
T'JON [on viewscreen]: Right. And how do we do that? <br>
PICARD: What is the matter with these people? How can he be Captain of
that vessel and not understand its simplest function? <br>
PICARD: Captain, how long have you been in command of this freighter? <br>
T'JON [on viewscreen]: Seven years. This is my twenty-sixth voyage to
Brekka. <br>
PICARD: And you don't know how to align a control coil? <br>
T'JON [on viewscreen]: It's never come up. <br>
RIKER: Can anyone else over there do it? <br>
T'JON [on viewscreen]: Hold on. I'll ask. Sorry. Nobody here knows
anything about it. <br>
RIKER: I'd better get over with a team. <br>
TASHA: Captain, I strongly recommend against anyone from this ship
beaming over. The solar interference is too great. <br>
WORF: The freighter has entered the planet's atmosphere. Disintegration
is imminent. <br>
RIKER: We're running out of options. <br>
PICARD: Let's get them off there. T'Jon, stand by to beam over. <br>
T'JON [on viewscreen]: If you think that's best. <br>
PICARD: Unless you have any other options, yes, I think that's best. <br>
T'JON [on viewscreen]: Whatever you say.

only of us, but of an entire civilisation. I'm sorry, I do not mean to
insult you. I'm feeling very shaky. <br>
ROMAS: We cannot hold out much longer. <br>
CRUSHER: They believe it will help them. That in itself might control
their symptoms. <br>

when the doorbell chimes. Picard enters) <br>
SOBI: May I say, Captain, how impressed we are with your ship and all
its facilities. <br>
PICARD: Thank you. <br>
LANGOR: And its crew. Everyone is so efficient and professional. <br>
PICARD: I am glad you are comfortable. I've come to seek your agreement
to an Ornaran request. <br>
SOBI: We cannot agree <br>
LANGOR: Wait. Let the Captain speak. We want to be reasonable. <br>
PICARD: The two Ornarans are really quite ill and insisting that they
need felicium. <br>
SOBI: That is not surprising. <br>
PICARD: Would you object to giving them enough for their own immediate
needs? <br>
SOBI: Captain, we Brekkians are in business. We are not in the habit of
giving away what has not been paid for. <br>
PICARD: You would see them die rather than share the medicine? <br>
LANGOR: We want to be fair, Captain. We agree to permitting them two
dosages for immediate use. <br>
SOBI: No charge. <br>
PICARD: I'll let my Medical Officer handle it. <br>
LANGOR: Captain, I trust you won't mind if we're present while you open
the cargo.

top of the powder) <br>
CRUSHER: What does that device do? <br>
SOBI: This measures the individual portions. <br>
(He takes a few grains and puts them into the device) <br>
CRUSHER: What's the dosage? <br>
LANGOR: Point zero one millilitres. <br>
CRUSHER: Very potent substance. <br>
SOBI: We've improved our distillation process over the years. <br>
LANGOR: In my grandfather's day, the same amount of felicium would have
filled five rooms this size. <br>
SOBI: But now with our improved processes, this one barrel contains
over four billion doses. <br>
DATA: I would estimate four billion, three hundred seventy five million
<br>
PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. <br>
CRUSHER: How long is the dosage effective? <br>
LANGOR: It varies with the individual. <br>
SOBI: But never more than seventy two hours. <br>
CRUSHER: And then the symptoms return. <br>
LANGOR: Yes. Unfortunately, there is no cure for the plague. <br>
SOBI: But felicium inhibits the sickness with total efficiency. <br>
LANGOR: Allowing the Ornarans to lead normal lives. <br>
CRUSHER: An unusual disease. Virulent, extremely persistent, yet I
can't isolate it. <br>
LANGOR: The plague has baffled doctors on both planets for two hundred
years. <br>
SOBI: We've therefore concentrated on treatment, finding new ways to
improve the potency and purity of felicium. <br>
DATA: No doubt you have applied your technology from other industries
to the refinement of this product. <br>
SOBI: We have no other industry. <br>
PICARD: None at all? <br>
LANGOR: We don't need any. The Ornarans provide us everything we need
in exchange for this. <br>
DATA: Fascinating. Your society is dedicated exclusively to the
production of a single product. <br>
PICARD: A product for which you have no use, but which the Ornarans
can't live without. <br>
LANGOR: One of the little ironies of life, Captain. <br>
SOBI: But one we'd be fools not to take advantage of. It's mutually
beneficial. <br>
LANGOR: The Ornarans provide us with the necessities of life, and we
provide them with the necessities of living. It is a fair exchange. <br>
PICARD: Interesting relationship. <br>

CRUSHER: T'Jon and Romas are feeling fine. In fact, too fine.
Felicium's a narcotic. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: I think you'll find it's a fascinating tale
that we've come across here, Captain. <br>
PICARD: You've piqued my interest, Number One. Please continue. <br>
RIKER: Data, what have we got? <br>
DATA: Beginning several thousand years ago, the two worlds took
different paths. Ornara became technologically sophisticated, Brekka
did not. Then two hundred years ago, Ornara was stricken by a
devastating plague. <br>
RIKER: Their advanced technology could provide no solution. <br>
DATA: Somehow, and there is limited information on this point, the cure
was found in a plant indigenous to only Brekka, and which resisted all
attempts at cultivation on Ornara. <br>
RIKER: In any case, a trading situation developed which still exists. <br>
CRUSHER: A nice arrangement for the Brekkians. <br>
RIKER: And for the Ornarans. Without the medicine, they would all die. <br>
CRUSHER: No they wouldn't. Despite what the Ornarans have been saying,
it's not a medicine. It was a medicine, but it cured the plague two
hundred years ago. The plague is irrelevant now. It doesn't exist. <br>
RIKER: Then why are they so desperate for the felicium? <br>
CRUSHER: It's an addiction. The physical and psychological need is very
real. <br>
PICARD: Thank you. <br>
CRUSHER: What are you going to do? <br>
PICARD: Based on what we know so far, there's nothing I can do. <br>
CRUSHER: You don't think drug addiction and exploitation is sufficient
cause to do something? <br>
PICARD: This situation has existed for a very long time. These two
societies are intertwined in a symbiotic relationship. <br>
CRUSHER: With one society profiting at the expense of the other. <br>
PICARD: That's how you see it. <br>
CRUSHER: I can synthesise a non-addictive substitute which will ease
their withdrawal symptoms. <br>
PICARD: No, I can't do that either. <br>
CRUSHER: You can't let them have the felicium. <br>
PICARD: Why? Because it offends against our sensibilities? It is not
our mission to impose Federation or Earth values on any others in the
galaxy. <br>
CRUSHER: Well in this case, Captain, I disagree, one hundred percent. <br>
TASHA: Captain, I'm receiving a call from Ornara. The signal is ragged,
but I think I can put it on the viewscreen. <br>
PICARD: Do it. <br>
MARGAN [on viewscreen]: I'm Margan. Are my people on board your ship? <br>
PICARD: Some of them, yes. <br>
MARGAN [on viewscreen]: May I speak to them? <br>
PICARD: Yes. Lieutenant Yar, have the Ornarans brought in. No, wait, I
don't want them to have access to the Bridge. We will contact you in a
few minutes. (end transmission) I will continue this in the guest
quarters. Commander, Doctor. <br>
(Picard, Riker and Crusher leave) <br>
WESLEY: Data, I can understand how this could happen to the Ornarans.
What I can't understand is why anyone would voluntarily become
dependent on a chemical. <br>
DATA: Voluntary addiction to drugs is a recurrent theme in many
cultures. <br>
TASHA: Wesley, no one wants to become dependent. That happens later. <br>
WESLEY: But it does happen. So why do people start? <br>
TASHA: On my home planet, there was so much poverty and violence, that
for some the only escape was through drugs. <br>
WESLEY: How can a chemical substance can provide an escape. <br>
TASHA: It doesn't, but it makes you think it does. You have to
understand, drugs can make you feel good. They make you feel on top of
the world. You're happy, sure of yourself, in control. <br>
WESLEY: But it's artificial. <br>
TASHA: It doesn't feel artificial until the drug wears off. Then you
pay the price. Before you know it, you're taking the drug not to feel
good, but to keep from feeling bad. <br>
WESLEY: And that's the trap? <br>
TASHA: All you care about is getting your next dosage. Nothing else
matters. <br>
WESLEY: I guess I just don't understand. <br>
TASHA: Wesley, I hope you never do. <br>

great. People are dying. It doesn't matter whether we're entitled to it
or not. We must have it. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LANGOR: We have thought about this a great deal. <br>
SOBI: We both of us feel deeply about what is happening on Ornara. <br>
LANGOR: Although it is going to cause hardship to us and to our people,
we have decided to give the felicium to them. <br>
SOBI: They can pay whenever they are able. <br>
LANGOR: We don't want to be the ones responsible for their suffering. <br>
PICARD: There goes the other shoe. They know. <br>
CRUSHER: What do they know? <br>
PICARD: They know that the Ornarans no longer have the plague. They
know that felicium is no longer a medicine. So, of course, they are
willing to give this shipment because they don't want to take the
chance that the Ornarans will lose their addiction. They don't want to
lose their only customers. <br>
CRUSHER: How would they have known all that, unless the plague had once
infected their world as well. <br>
PICARD: They were infected. They used the felicium to cure themselves,
but somehow their ancestors realised that it was a narcotic. <br>
CRUSHER: They broke the cycle of addiction and never told the Ornarans.
They let them continue to believe that without the felicium they would
die. <br>
PICARD: I think it's worse than that. My guess is this refining process
of which you are so proud <br>
CRUSHER: is only to increase the potency of the felicium and tighten
your grip! <br>
SOBI: What are you going to do? <br>
LANGOR: Are you going to tell them? <br>
PICARD: No. I'm bound by the rules of the United Federation of Planets,
which order me not to interfere with other worlds, other cultures. If I
were to tell them any of this, I would violate that Prime Directive. <br>
SOBI: But you are talking to us about it. <br>
PICARD: This is information you already know. And so nothing has
changed. <br>
LANGOR: If you can't interfere, then you are going to allow the
Ornarans to have the felicium? <br>
PICARD: Yes, I am. <br>
CRUSHER: No! Don't do it. Jean-Luc, this is not a symbiotic
relationship. This is exploitation, pure and simple! The Brekkians have
caused all of this suffering and hardship only to make their pitiful
lives easier! And all of it based on a lie. No, deny them this
shipment. It is the least we can do. <br>

were tied. <br>

Hold. Beverly, the Prime Directive is not just a set of rules. It is a
