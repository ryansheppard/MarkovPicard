Captain's log, Stardate 43917.4 The Enterprise has been given the
singular honour of hosting the first meeting between the Federation and
a mysterious race known as the Legarans. We are in orbit around Vulcan,
preparing to welcome aboard Federation Ambassador Sarek and his wife
Perrin, who like his first wife, is from Earth. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: I remember studying his career in school.
The treaty of Alpha Cygnus Nine, the Coridan admission to the
Federation, the Klingon Alliance. <br>
PICARD: I met him once, many years ago, very briefly at his son's
wedding. I can tell you that was quite a moment for a young lieutenant,
standing in the presence of such history. I remember he spoke to me and
I just stood there grinning like an idiot. <br>
RIKER: You? Tongue-tied? <br>
PICARD: Indeed. How do you make small talk with someone who shaped the
Federation? <br>
RIKER: Is it true that he'll be retiring after this mission? <br>
PICARD: Unofficially, that's what I hear. What a crowning achievement
for his career. The benefits of relations with the Legarans are
incalculable.

MENDROSSEN: Ah Captain Picard. I am Ki Mendrossen, the ambassador's
chief of staff. This is Sakkath, his personal assistant. <br>
PICARD: Has the ambassador been delayed? <br>
MENDROSSEN: He will be joining us momentarily. But first we must
discuss some matters of the utmost delicacy. <br>
PICARD: Please go ahead. <br>
MENDROSSEN: To be frank, Captain, the ambassador is not a young man. He
tires easily. <br>
SAKKATH: He's going to need a lot of rest to prepare himself for the
difficult job that awaits him. <br>
MENDROSSEN: Which is why it is imperative that he be allowed to
conserve his strength. I must request that you dispense with any formal
activities normally associated with a visitor of his rank. <br>
RIKER: We had planned a ship's concert this evening. <br>
PICARD: I believe the Ambassador is extremely fond of Mozart. <br>
MENDROSSEN: I'm afraid it would be impossible for him to attend. Upon
his arrival he will be taken directly to his quarters where he will
remain in seclusion until we reach Legara Four. <br>
PICARD: You have my assurance that the Ambassador will not be disturbed
during the voyage. <br>
MENDROSSEN: That's all we ask. Well, now that's settled, the Ambassador
is waiting. <br>
(Sarek and Perrin are beamed aboard) <br>
PICARD: Welcome aboard the Enterprise, Ambassador Sarek. <br>
SAREK: We come to serve. <br>
PICARD: Your service honours us. <br>
SAREK: Allow me to present she who is my wife. <br>
PICARD: Mrs. Sarek. <br>
PERRIN: Please call me Perrin, Captain. <br>
PICARD: This is my first officer, Commander William Riker. <br>
PERRIN: Captain, would you be so kind as to show us to our quarters? <br>
SAREK: I prefer to view the conference room first. <br>
MENDROSSEN: Ambassador, I'm sure Sakkath and I can handle all the
necessary details. <br>
SAREK: I will examine it for myself. <br>
PERRIN: Perhaps it would be best if we settled in first. <br>
SAREK: They worry about my health, Captain. Too much. You will take me
to the conference room, please. <br>
RIKER: If you'll follow me, sir.

WESLEY: Are the Legarans really going to sit in this stuff? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, I'm sure not. <br>
WESLEY: Can you believe this smell? <br>
LAFORGE: What smell? What can I say? To us it's a slime pit, but to
them it's home. <br>
WESLEY: Okay, the environmental controls are ready. What's next? <br>
LAFORGE: What, are you in some kind of hurry or something? <br>
WESLEY: Yeah, I have a date. <br>
LAFORGE: A date? With who? <br>
WESLEY: Ensign Dumont. <br>
LAFORGE: Really? She's very attractive. I've got to admit, Wes, I'm a
bit surprised. <br>
WESLEY: What, that she'd go out with me? <br>
LAFORGE: No, that you'd actually have the nerve to ask her. Way to go. <br>
(Sarek, Picard et al enter) <br>
SAREK: The room is not ready. <br>
PICARD: No Ambassador. Commander La Forge and Ensign Crusher are <br>
SAREK: The Legarans are very sensitive in matters of protocol. You will
remove all the furniture from the room. The walls must be bare. <br>
MENDROSSEN: I'm sure everything will be set up according to our
specifications before the Legarans arrive. Isn't that right, Captain? <br>
PICARD: I assure you, Ambassador, everything will be ready before the
conference begins. <br>
PERRIN: My husband and I have every confidence in you, Captain. <br>
SAREK: I have worked for ninety three years in preparation for this
meeting. It is vital that no detail be overlooked. <br>
SAKKATH: Perhaps we should allow these gentlemen to return to their
work, Ambassador. <br>
SAREK: That will be acceptable. These walls are too bright.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: The way Mendrossen described him, I expected
to see a frail old man. <br>
PICARD: I hope I'm that frail when I'm two hundred and two years old.
But his aides did seem to be a little overprotective, didn't they? <br>
RIKER: From what I could see, the Ambassador doesn't need to be
protected from anything. <br>
PICARD: Well, we'll respect Mister Mendrossen's request and allow
Ambassador Sarek his privacy. I suppose they were foolish and vain, my
expectations of this voyage. Sharing his thoughts, memories, his unique
understanding of the history he's made. <br>
TROI: Does this mean you're going to cancel the concert this evening? <br>
PICARD: No, the concert will ahead as scheduled. But it's a pity that
the guest of honour will be absent. <br>
RIKER: For all we know, the Ambassador might enjoy an evening's
entertainment <br>
TROI: Why not ask his wife if she'd like to attend? <br>
PICARD: That's an excellent idea, Counsellor. You have the Bridge,
Number One.

PICARD: I hope I'm not intruding. <br>
PERRIN: Not at all, Captain, but Sarek is in meditation at the moment. <br>
PICARD: Actually, I came to see you. <br>
PERRIN: Well, how nice. I so rarely get visitors of my own. Usually
everyone wants to see the Ambassador. <br>
PICARD: I find that hard to believe. Thank you. <br>
(They sit) <br>
PERRIN: These quarters are quite comfortable. The Ambassador and I were
very pleased when we heard that the negotiations were going to take
place aboard the flagship of the Federation. <br>
PICARD: The honour is ours. <br>
PERRIN: My husband has taken an interest in your career. He finds it to
be satisfactory. <br>
PICARD: My word! High praise from a Vulcan. <br>
PERRIN: Some people who expect an emotional response often find Vulcans
quite cold when they are merely being <br>
PICARD: Logical. <br>
PERRIN: Exactly. <br>
PICARD: I came to invite you, and your husband if he is available, to a
Mozart recital this evening. <br>
PERRIN: What a tempting offer. I doubt that the Ambassador will be able
to attend, but I will make it a point to ask him. <br>
PICARD: Well, then I hope to see you tonight. <br>

WESLEY: Is that it? Can I get out of here now? <br>
LAFORGE: What's your hurry? You don't really think something's going to
happen with Suzanne Dumont, do you? <br>
WESLEY: At least I'm not spending the night with a good book like some
people. <br>
LAFORGE: What's that supposed to mean? <br>
WESLEY: Just what it sounds like. <br>
LAFORGE: Let me tell you something. You'd get more action out of a good
book than you'll ever see on this date, I'll guarantee it. She's not
going to waste her time on someone like you. <br>
WESLEY: Someone like me? <br>

WESLEY: Since when did you become an expert on women? <br>
LAFORGE: Compared to you, every male on this ship is an expert on
women. <br>
WESLEY: Well at least I don't have to find my women on the holodeck! <br>

was a moment when I actually thought that the two of them were going to
hit one each other. <br>

PICARD: Ambassador Sarek, Perrin, on behalf of the entire crew,
welcome. <br>
SAREK: It was my wife's suggestion that we attend. It seemed an ideal
diversion. Perrin can be quite logical, when she so chooses. <br>
MENDROSSEN: It seems that the Ambassador had more free time than I
anticipated. <br>
PICARD: Commander Data will be our featured soloist this evening. <br>
DATA: I have been programmed to reproduce the individual musical styles
of over three hundred concert violinists, including Heifetz, Menuhin,
Grak-tay and Tataglia. Do you have a preference? <br>
PERRIN: Tataglia would be lovely. <br>

test I know. I've checked the water, food replicators, airborne
samples. <br>

affect the Ambassador. I want his quarters isolated from the rest of
the crew until we've identified the cause. <br>
TROI: It's not that simple, Captain. <br>

virtually the same time Sarek and his party beamed onto the ship.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: We do have a working theory. We believe
that it's possible Ambassador Sarek himself is responsible for these
incidents. <br>
PICARD: Sarek? <br>
TROI: I felt something during the concert. Vague and undefined, but
very disturbing <br>
PICARD: He cried. I saw that. I couldn't believe it. A Vulcan moved to
tears by music? It's <br>
TROI: Well, Vulcans have the same basic emotions we do. They've just
learned to repress them. What I sensed during the concert was that he'd
lost control. <br>
PICARD: What would cause such a loss of control? <br>
CRUSHER: There's a very rare condition that sometimes affects Vulcans
over the age of two hundred. Bendii Syndrome. Its early symptoms
include sudden bursts of emotion, mostly irrational anger. Eventually,
all emotional control is lost. <br>
PICARD: I can imagine nothing that would be more offensive to a Vulcan.
Their emotional detachment is the very core of
their being. How would this affect others on board the ship? <br>
TROI: Vulcans possess telepathic ability. Sarek may unintentionally be
projecting intense emotions onto other people, at random. <br>
PICARD: And when the Legarans beam on board? <br>
CRUSHER: They could very well be affected too. <br>
PICARD: Is there a treatment? <br>
CRUSHER: Can't someone else take his place? <br>
PICARD: Sarek has built a personal relationship with them. They will
accept no one else. How can we confirm your diagnosis? <br>
CRUSHER: We can grow a culture from the tissue of the metathalamus, but
the results will take several days. <br>

MENDROSSEN: I give you my word of honour that the Ambassador is in
perfect health. Is that enough? <br>
PICARD: Mister Mendrossen <br>
MENDROSSEN: You are dealing with a theory full of holes, Captain. Why
am I not affected by Sarek's supposed condition? And Perrin. How could
his wife function normally if this theory of yours is correct? <br>
PICARD: I cannot explain that. Hundreds of others on board have not
been affected either. I have not. It appears to be random. Proximity,
apparently, has no bearing on the phenomenon. <br>

mind on the eve of his greatest triumph, and you cannot explain why. I
won't report this to the Ambassador, for the moment. I don't want to
divert his attention from the mission. But if I were you, in the

dignity, the slow betrayal of our bodies by forces we cannot master. Do
you still want to be one of us, Data? <br>
DATA: Sir, it is conceivable, even for me, that time will eventually
lead to irreparable circuit failure. But there is one thing I do not
understand. Sarek is a logical, intelligent being. The effects of
Bendii Syndrome are apparent. Why would such a man choose to ignore
them? <br>
PICARD: Logic fails us sometimes, Data. I think this is one of those
times. I can only guess that he does not see, or he does not wish to
see, the truth. And he is being insulated against that truth by those
who love him most. <br>

Mendrossen, even you. <br>

(Sarek, Sakkath and Mendrossen come out of the bedroom) <br>
SAREK: Must not do what, my wife? If Captain Picard wishes to see me,
he may do so. I regret that we have seen so little of each other during
this voyage, Captain. <br>
PICARD: The loss is mine, Ambassador. <br>
MENDROSSEN: Captain, may I talk with you in private? <br>
SAREK: You were speaking of your belief that I suffer from Bendii
Syndrome. I have been accused of many things in my life, never an
excess of emotion. <br>
PERRIN: Sarek, I see no reason to continue this discussion. <br>
SAREK: On the contrary, I wish to assuage any fears the Captain may
have regarding my capabilities. I believe there is a test for Bendii
Syndrome. I will take it immediately. <br>
PICARD: Unfortunately the results would not be available for several
days, which is why I must ask for a postponement of the conference. <br>
SAREK: That would be a mistake. Captain, I give you my word. I am in
perfect health. <br>
PICARD: Then why must Sakkath help to contain your emotions? <br>
SAREK: Is what the captain says true? <br>
MENDROSSEN: No, Ambassador, absolutely not. <br>
SAREK: Perrin, were you aware of this? Sakkath, I await an answer. <br>
SAKKATH: I have been using my limited abilities to strengthen your
mental discipline. <br>
SAREK: Your efforts will no longer be required! <br>
SAKKATH: That would not be wise. <br>
SAREK: It may not be wise but it is necessary. <br>
(Sakkath leaves) <br>
SAREK: Leave me. I wish to speak with Captain Picard. <br>
PERRIN: Sarek, I ask you to reconsider. <br>
SAREK: Obey my wishes. There is nothing to fear. <br>
(Perrin and Mendrossen leave) <br>
PICARD: I hope I've not embarrassed you, Ambassador. <br>
SAREK: You seem to forget, Captain, that I am a Vulcan. I am not
affected by emotional considerations. <br>
PICARD: I think you are affected, sir, far more than you realise. <br>
SAREK: I am a logical being. Present your arguments. I will listen. <br>
PICARD: There is an epidemic of violent incidents aboard the
Enterprise. As we speak, the situation is worsening. <br>
SAREK: And it is your hypothesis that I am the cause of these
incidents? <br>
PICARD: Yes. My Chief Medical Officer has explored all other probable
causes. <br>
SAREK: I share your concern for your crew. However, you must agree it
is not unusual for a starship to encounter unexplained phenomena. <br>
PICARD: That is correct. <br>
SAREK: Therefore, since I can assure you that I am not the cause of
your difficulties, the logical course would be to have your doctor to
continue her search. <br>
PICARD: She is. It is also a fact that these incidents began shortly
after your arrival. <br>
SAREK: Is your entire argument to be based on mere coincidence? <br>
PICARD: Is it also coincidence that your wife and chief of staff are
carefully isolating you? <br>
SAREK: Ah. I believe I see the flaw in your logic. You are reacting to
their overprotective attitudes towards me.
They are both somewhat emotional concerning my age. <br>
PICARD: Surely Sakkath cannot be influenced by emotion? <br>
SAREK: Am I to be blamed for the judgment of a child? Sakkath is young
and inexperienced. He erred in his assumption that I needed help! <br>
PICARD: But you needed his help at the concert. Or is there possibly
some other logical explanation for what happened that night? <br>
SAREK: What happened? <br>
PICARD: I saw you crying. <br>
SAREK: I do not cry. <br>
PICARD: I was there I saw the tears. <br>
SAREK: You exaggerate, Captain. I recall only one tear. <br>
PICARD: So you were emotionally affected by the music. <br>
SAREK: That is not possible! <br>
PICARD: You still haven't answered my question, Sarek. Is it logical
for a Vulcan to cry? <br>
SAREK: It was late. I was fatigued. Nothing more. The Legarans trust
only me. They will not meet with any other member of the Federation. I
must be allowed to complete my mission! There are no other logical
solutions! <br>
PICARD: No other logical solutions? But Ambassador, there are always
other solutions. You have said so yourself many times. <br>
SAREK: What I meant was that <br>
PICARD: Sarek of Vulcan would never be afraid of looking straight at
something he did not want to see. <br>
SAREK: I warn you! Your efforts to discredit me will not succeed! <br>
PICARD: Sarek of Vulcan never confused what he wanted with the truth. <br>
SAREK: I will not be spoken to in this manner! <br>
PICARD: Do I hear anger in your voice? <br>
SAREK: It would be illogical for a Vulcan to show anger! It would be
illogical! Illogical! Illogical! Illogical!

Shall I have Mister Worf contact their ambassador? <br>
PICARD: No. I will present our regrets to the Legarans personally. It
is vital that they understand our reasons for cancelling these
negotiations. <br>
RIKER: Captain, I think you did the right thing. <br>
PICARD: But at what cost, Number One? <br>
(door bell) <br>
PICARD: Come. Perrin? <br>
PERRIN: I must speak with you, Captain. <br>
RIKER: I'll be on the Bridge, sir. <br>
(Riker leaves) <br>
PICARD: How is the Ambassador? <br>
PERRIN: Resting. I've come to ask you to reconsider your position. <br>
PICARD: You know that is impossible. <br>
PERRIN: Sarek is a good man. He's given the Federation a lifetime of
service. I beg you to let him keep the respect he has earned. <br>
PICARD: He'll never lose that respect. <br>
PERRIN: Mendrossen and I never wanted to deceive you. My husband's
condition came on him so gradually it was so easy to delude ourselves
and pretend that nothing was wrong. We convinced ourselves that he
could complete this one last task and end his career with dignity. Help
him, Captain. Help him regain his pride, his honour. <br>
PICARD: Believe me, it would give me great pleasure, but there is
nothing I can do. <br>
PERRIN: The mission can be saved. But he needs your help to do it.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SAREK: A mind-meld? Between the two of us? Do you
realise the dangers involved in what you are proposing, Captain? <br>
PICARD: Yes, I do, Ambassador. But I also realise the potential
benefits. <br>
SAREK: We would be linked telepathically, sharing our thoughts,
becoming in essence one mind. <br>
PICARD: Which, for a few hours, should provide the emotional control
you need. In that time, you can meet with the Legarans and conclude the
treaty. <br>
SAREK: It is a generous offer. But I must warn you that while I would
gain your stability, you would experience the fierce onslaught of
emotions unleashed by my condition. Vulcan emotions are extremely
intense. We have learned to suppress them. No human would be able to
control them. They would overwhelm you. The mind-meld can be a terrible
intimacy. I cannot allow it. <br>
PICARD: I'm aware of the risks. But it is the only logical solution. <br>
SAREK: Your courage honours me, Captain.

left but dry bones and dead friends. Tired, oh so tired. <br>

fine. Just hold on. <br>
PICARD: No! This weakness disgusts me! I hate it! Where is my logic? I
am betrayed by desires. I want to feel. I want to feel everything. But
I am a Vulcan. I must feel nothing. Give me back my control. <br>
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc! <br>
PICARD: Perrin. Amanda. I wanted to give you so much more. I wanted to
show you such tenderness. But that is not our way. Spock, Amanda, did
you know? Perrin, can you know how much I love you? I do love you! <br>

PICARD: Beverly. <br>
CRUSHER: I'm here, Jean-Luc. I'm not going anywhere. <br>

pouring out of him, all those feelings, the regrets. I can't stop them.
