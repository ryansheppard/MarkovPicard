REMMICK: Yes. To the best of your knowledge, has the Captain ever
falsified a log? <br>

control over this vessel. He handed it over to Kosinski, who took the
entire crew to the edge of the universe. <br>
LAFORGE: No, sir. That's not what I'm saying. Now, Kosinski was sent by
Starfleet to improve our warp drive system. Captain Picard was ordered
to take him aboard. <br>
REMMICK: According to his own logs, his Bridge crew didn't think highly
of Mister Kosinski's theories, yet the Captain allowed him to access to
the engines anyway. Is that true, La Forge? <br>
LAFORGE: Not exactly, sir. <br>
REMMICK: One way or the other, La Forge, Picard lost control of this

REMMICK: Not even the Ferengi incident with his old ship, the
Stargazer? <br>

WESLEY: Wait. I thought I wanted to be alone, but I guess I don't. <br>
WORF: How is the testing? <br>
WESLEY: Okay. So far. It's not the ones that I've studied for that I'm
worried about. It's the psych test. Facing my deepest fear and living
through it. I'm trying to figure out what images to bring up. <br>
WORF: Why? <br>
WESLEY: I guess I want to scare myself. What do you think? Bulgallian
rats? Lightning storms? <br>
WORF: Do those things frighten you? <br>
WESLEY: Sort of, I guess. <br>
WORF: The psych test is no more or less important than the rest of the
process. <br>
WESLEY: That's what they said, but I can't stop thinking about it. <br>
WORF: Thinking about what you can't control only wastes your energy and
creates its own enemy. <br>
WESLEY: How can they know what my deepest fear is when I don't? <br>
WORF: By analysing your psychological profile. They were very accurate
about everyone I tested with. Including myself. <br>
WESLEY: You? I thought there was nothing that could frighten a Klingon
warrior. <br>
WORF: Only fools have no fear. <br>
WESLEY: I'm sorry, Lieutenant. I'm asking too many personal questions. <br>
WORF: It is very difficult for me to depend on anyone for anything. But
especially for my life. <br>
WESLEY: But on the Enterprise you do that every day. Everyone depends
on everyone else to protect them. <br>

DATA: Acceptable or not, sir, it is the truth. <br>
REMMICK: Just how did this contaminant get aboard the ship? <br>
WORF: By accident, sir. <br>
REMMICK: Meaning Captain Picard has no standing procedure for this type
of situation? <br>
WORF: No. Meaning by accident, sir. <br>
REMMICK: You don't like me very much, do you? <br>
WORF: Is it required, sir? <br>
REMMICK: How would you characterise your relationship with Captain
Picard? <br>
CRUSHER: We're Starfleet officers who've known each other for many
years. <br>
REMMICK: Everything said here is confidential, Doctor. You can be
completely open with me. <br>
CRUSHER: About what? <br>
REMMICK: About how you feel serving with a man who is responsible for
the death of your husband. <br>
CRUSHER: My personal feelings about Captain Picard are irrelevant to
this investigation, and none of your business. <br>
REMMICK: Then you confirm the accuracy of the log report. You violated
the Prime Directive with the Edo. You deliberately interfered with
their laws. <br>
PICARD: Yes. It's exactly as I explained it in the log records. <br>
REMMICK: All to save Doctor Crusher's son? <br>
PICARD: A member of my crew was being held unjustly. I stand by my
decision. Mister Remmick, you have talked to every member of this ship.
I think you've had enough time to find out whatever it is you're
looking for. <br>
REMMICK: Are you afraid if I keep looking that I'll find you're guilty?
<br>
PICARD: The only thing I'm guilty of is allowing this charade to go on
so long.

REMMICK: Admiral, I've done my best to be thorough during this
investigation. <br>
QUINN: Continue. <br>
REMMICK: I couldn't find what you asked, sir. I spoke to officer after
officer, at length. I pried into the ships log reports. And yet I could
find nothing wrong. Except, perhaps, a casual familiarity among the
Bridge crew, but mostly that comes from a sense of teamwork, and the
feeling of family. I'm sorry, sir. I did my best. <br>
QUINN: Quite. You're dismissed, Commander. <br>
REMMICK: Yes, sir. Captain Picard, my tour in the Inspector General's
office will be up in six months. When I'm finished, this is where I'd
like to serve, sir. <br>
(No reply, and Remmick leaves) <br>
QUINN: Don't judge the young man too harshly. He's a good officer. <br>
PICARD: It's not him I'm inclined to judge. <br>
QUINN: Don't judge me too harshly either, until I've finished. We had
to be very sure of you. Some of us at Starfleet Command became
suspicious of certain problems in the Federation. <br>
PICARD: What kind of problems? <br>
QUINN: Something or someone is trying to destroy the fabric of
everything we've built up in the last two hundred years. <br>
PICARD: What's your evidence? <br>
QUINN: I can't go into that. There are too many people involved. <br>
PICARD: What do you want from me? <br>
QUINN: I don't know whether the threat comes from the inside or whether
it's from outside. I need people I can trust in strong positions
throughout the Federation. <br>
PICARD: You have my complete support. You know that. <br>
QUINN: That's not enough. I want to promote you to Admiral, and I want
you to take over as Commandant of Starfleet Academy. <br>
PICARD: The Academy. <br>
QUINN: Yes. <br>
PICARD: The Academy? <br>
QUINN: I need you close. <br>
PICARD: Then there was never a problem with the Enterprise. <br>
QUINN: No, but I had to be sure you hadn't been co-opted. <br>
PICARD: Greg, this is politics, and I'm not good at politics. Surely
there are others who are better suited. <br>
QUINN: All right. Even if I am wrong, and I hope I am, you're still the
best man for the job. <br>
PICARD: I appreciate the value of what you're offering. It's not a
decision I can make quickly. <br>
QUINN: I need an answer soon. <br>

unfair that only one candidate from Relva will attend the Academy this

slightly higher than Mister Crusher's. Congratulations, Mister Mordock.
