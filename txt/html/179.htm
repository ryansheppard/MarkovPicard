Medical Officer's log, Stardate 44161.2. We are docking at Starbase one

aboard my mentor, and dear friend, Doctor Dalen Quaice, who will be
travelling with us to his home planet, Kenda Two.

CRUSHER: You look wonderful. <br>

QUAICE: She'd been ill for some time. <br>
CRUSHER: Is her death the reason you're giving up your post here? <br>
QUAICE: We had a lifetime together, doing all the things we'd ever
dreamed, and more. But when she was gone, I couldn't continue to work
in that office, sleep in that bed without her. The absence of her was
too distracting. I'm not sure that I'm making any sense. <br>
CRUSHER: Jack and I didn't have a lifetime together, only a few short
years, but I understand. When you realise someone you love is lost
forever <br>
QUAICE: You know what the worst part of growing old is? So many of the
people you've known all your life are gone and you realise you didn't
take the time to appreciate them while you still could. Oh, I'm sorry.
There was no reason to heap all this emotional baggage on you. I
usually travel light.

PICARD: I've read your reports. <br>
LAFORGE: We did a test run while we were still at the starbase. Here's
what the computer recorded. <br>
WESLEY: This is the static warp field we created inside the warp drive.
The experiment was designed to see if we could keep a bubble like this
intact. <br>
LAFORGE: As you'll see in a moment, we couldn't. <br>
LAFORGE: There was a momentary flash of light. It was all over the
spectrum. <br>
CRUSHER: I remember that. <br>

disappear? <br>
WESLEY: If he were caught in it, yes, sir, it would seem to us like
he'd disappeared. <br>
CRUSHER: Where would he go? <br>
LAFORGE: Who knows. He could even end up outside of our space time
continuum. <br>
PICARD: Was Doctor Quaice in Engineering during your experiment? <br>

memories. Keep at it, Ensign, Mister La Forge. It's our only working

Tea, Earl Grey, hot. You're saying this ship has lost nearly eight
hundred of its personnel? <br>

Wesley's experiment clearly did not have the scope to affect an entire
starship. <br>

me. <br>
PICARD: I have no choice but to believe you. The safety of my entire
crew is at stake, but I must be sure. <br>
CRUSHER: That I haven't lost my mind? I just examined myself. And being
the only doctor on board, I had to do it myself. There were no signs of
dysfunction. Yes, there was an increased elevation of adrenalin, but I
think is understandable. <br>

the only one among us unaffected by this, this phenomenon? <br>

functions. <br>

vital signs. Audible readout. Begin now. <br>
COMPUTER: Body temperature thirty seven point two degrees, (continues
in background) <br>
CRUSHER: I promise you I will continue to do whatever I can to find out
what's happening, and to bring you all back. I'm sorry I lost my
temper. You do remember that? <br>
PICARD: Vividly. But if I have forgotten my closest friends and
comrades, as you say, I deserved every word. <br>
CRUSHER: For quite some time I've been meaning to say something to you.
I might not have another chance. (she looks away for a moment) Jean
Luc, you and I <br>

TRAVELLER: Your species have very narrow perceptions of time and space
and thought. When Beverly Crusher was caught in the static warp bubble,
she created her own reality. Her thoughts at the precise moment she was
trapped determined its shape and form. <br>

TRAVELLER: No, it is her reality. I cannot enter it any more than I can
enter her thoughts. <br>

TRAVELLER: I can help, but I can't do it myself. Wesley, there is a
power within each of us that most people haven't begun to realise, but
you have begun, or else I would not have known to come here now.
Together we may be able to open a gateway for her. But she must choose
