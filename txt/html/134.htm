RIKER: Welcome aboard the Enterprise. I'm Commander William Riker, your
First Officer. Those of you who are here as replacements will step
outside follow Lieutenant Lewis. He will assign you to your crew
quarters. (to the Benzite) Ensign, you're here on the exchange
programme. If you'll just follow Mister Crusher. <br>
WESLEY: Mordoc, what are you doing here? You couldn't have graduated
from the Academy already. <br>
MENDON: I am not Mordoc. I am Mendon. Ensign Mendon from the planet
Benzar. <br>
WESLEY: Sorry. It's a friend of mine. You look just like him. <br>
MENDON: We are from the same geostructure. Naturally we look alike. <br>
WESLEY: How do you tell each other apart? <br>
MENDON: We just do. <br>
RIKER: It's nice to have you here, Ensign. There will be a briefing and
indoctrination session in fifteen minutes. <br>
MENDON: I want to tell you how happy I am to be assigned to the
Enterprise. It wasn't just luck. I requested it. I know I can be of
great help to the ship. <br>
RIKER: Yes, of course. If you'll just follow Mister Crusher. <br>

PICARD: I was wondering if you had any feelings about the Officer
Exchange Programme initiated by Starfleet Command. <br>
RIKER: Just positive ones, sir. Actually, I just welcomed Ensign Mendon
on board. He certainly seems eager to please. <br>
PICARD: Well, that's a Benzite trait. It's been suggested that an
officer from the Enterprise might participate in the programme. <br>
RIKER: That's probably a good idea. <br>
PICARD: Well, there is a Klingon vessel in the area. <br>
RIKER: I don't recall hearing of a Federation officer serving ever on a
Klingon vessel. <br>
PICARD: No, no, neither have I. <br>
RIKER: It might prove to be beneficial. <br>
PICARD: Having Worf on board certainly has been. <br>
RIKER: Yes, sir. Who did you intend to send, sir? <br>
PICARD: I thought of asking for a volunteer. <br>
RIKER: I might be interested, sir. <br>
PICARD: (missing a target) Damn. Sorry, Number One, what was that? <br>
RIKER: I said I wouldn't mind the assignment, sir. <br>
PICARD: Any particular reason? <br>
RIKER: Because nobody's ever done it before. <br>
PICARD: I'll notify Starbase of your acceptance They'll contact the
Klingon vessel, make the arrangements.

heritage. <br>
RIKER: Then you're just the person I need to talk to, clear something
up. It's my understanding that one of the duties of the First Officer
of a Klingon ship is to assassinate his Captain? <br>
WORF: Yes, sir. <br>
RIKER: Wouldn't that bring about chaos? <br>
WORF: Of course not. When and if the Captain becomes weak and unable to
perform, it is expected that his honourable retirement should be
assisted by his First. Your Second Officer will assassinate you for the
same reasons. <br>
RIKER: The method of attrition must take a little getting used to. <br>
WORF: The Klingon system has operated successfully for centuries. <br>
RIKER: It is different. <br>
WORF: Many things will be different.

around) <br>
CREWMAN: (at Worf's station) Can I help you, sir? <br>
MENDON: That's a wonderful method of maintaining a constant control
factor over defensive shields, but I'm sure there's a way to improve
response time. Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt you. Just thought I
could be of some help. However, I am correct in what I said. <br>
(He moves on down to the helm and ops stations) <br>
MENDON: That is superb designing. Absolutely first rate. <br>
WESLEY: Yes, it is. Would you care to be more specific? <br>
MENDON: The input sampling. It's simple yet efficient enough. Of course
a minor change of the helm readout would be much more helpful in
emergency situations. <br>
WESLEY: We've never had any problems with it. Have you seen it work? <br>
MENDON: Not in a practical exercise, but in theory, my theory, it would
be more than a marginal improvement. I'll have to mention this to the
Captain. He is open to some astute observations, isn't he? <br>
WESLEY: I've never known the Captain not to listen to one of his
officers. <br>
MENDON: Outstanding. Soon we'll get things running perfectly.

RIKER: It's a Klingon delicacy. Pipius claw. This is heart of targ.
This, of course, is gagh. <br>
PULASKI: Gagh? <br>
RIKER: Yes, serpent worms. Would you like some? <br>
PULASKI: No, thanks. I've never heard of a Klingon starving to death on
his own vessels, but you might. <br>
RIKER: Not if I weaken first. <br>
PULASKI: I know all about that. Their beliefs are rather brutal, but
usually what kills us kills them. <br>
RIKER: That's certainly good to know. Would you like something to
drink? <br>
PULASKI: I'm abstaining in honour of your last hour on board. <br>
RIKER: Your sacrifice will not go unnoticed. <br>
PICARD: Well, I'm familiar with the practice of the feast before the
transfer. I've done it dozens of times. However, I usually made more
palatable choices. <br>
RIKER: These are the more palatable choices. <br>
(Riker offers Picard a jug of something rather solid-looking with
tentacles) <br>
PICARD: Thank you. We know so little about them. There really is so
much to learn. This is a great opportunity. I envy you, Mister Riker. <br>

RIKER: I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. <br>
KARGAN: This ship is equipped with our best weapons and our finest
warriors. Although we are on a peaceful mission, we are ready to go
into battle instantly. I know I can count on every Klingon warrior in
this crew to serve and die in that battle. So I ask you again,
Commander Riker. Where are your loyalties? <br>
RIKER: I have been assigned to serve this ship and to obey your orders.
And I will do exactly that. <br>
KARGAN: Will you take an oath to that effect? <br>
RIKER: I just did. <br>
KLAG: (in Klingon) Do not believe him! He lies! <br>

on the floor, then kicking him down before he can get up again, and
finally ramming his head into a computer panel. Lots of sparks. Kargan
laughs)<br>
RIKER: My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern
is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner
to that of Lieutenant? <br>

The Klingon ship. <br>
PICARD: And whom did you inform? <br>
MENDON: No one. I have not yet completed my full analysis. <br>
WORF: You are supposed to report whatever is out of the ordinary. <br>
PICARD: And I think that falls into this category. <br>
MENDON: But sir, as I said, I have not yet completed my full analysis.
It would be improper to report it until then. <br>
DATA: How did you come to that decision? <br>
MENDON: It is a Benzite regulation. No officer on the deck of one of
our ships would report an occurrence like this until he had a full
analysis and a resolution. I have simply followed proper procedures. <br>
PICARD: It is our procedure, Ensign, to notify command of any
possibility of danger to the ship. The decision is not yours. Do you
understand? <br>
MENDON: Yes, sir. <br>
PICARD: Now, you will continue with your analysis and determine the
danger, not only to our ship, but the Klingon vessel also. <br>
MENDON: Yes, Captain. That will take a couple of hours. <br>

encountered a new life form. I want to know everything about it as
quickly as possible. Commander Data, supervise. <br>

to this attack. Engage cloaking device. Change course to intercept the

KARGAN: What is the status? <br>
TACTICS: Unchanged. The rate of increase continues. <br>
KARGAN: Commander Riker, check the organism growth with Engineering. <br>
(Riker leaves) <br>
KARGAN: Keep him under scrutiny. <br>
KLAG: Captain, I'm not convinced Riker knew of any plot against us. If
he did, why would he have come on board? <br>
KARGAN: Because he was ordered to. <br>
KLAG: To die? <br>
KARGAN: It's the expectation of any officer to be ordered to die at any
time. <br>
KLAG: For a Klingon perhaps, but Riker's people do not volunteer for
death so easily. He may be a spy, but he's no coward. <br>
KARGAN: That only proves that he is intelligent. And you might not be
as strong as you used to be. <br>
TACTICS: Captain, I've picked up the Enterprise. <br>
KARGAN: So soon? <br>
TACTICS: The Enterprise is on an intercept course with us. <br>
(Riker enters) <br>
KARGAN: You almost had me believing this was a misunderstanding. <br>
RIKER: But? <br>
KARGAN: The Enterprise has changed course and is following us. Why? <br>
RIKER: Ask them. <br>
KARGAN: The reason is obvious. Their intent is clear. How long before
we make contact? <br>
TACTICS: Less than fifteen minutes, sir. <br>
KARGAN: Put the ship on full battle alert. Arm all photon torpedoes.
Let them charge into their destruction.

KARGAN: I understand fully. Now, you understand. I am still Captain of
this vessel and you are still crew and sworn to obey me. You gave me
your oath. <br>

KARGAN: Then fulfill that oath and serve this ship as you swore to.
Tell me of the surest method of attack against the Enterprise. <br>
RIKER: I won't. <br>
KARGAN: You must. It is a matter of honour and loyalty to your oath. <br>
RIKER: I will not surrender the secrets of the Enterprise to you. <br>
KARGAN: If your word is no good, then how can we ever trust Starfleet? <br>
RIKER: I will not break any vow I have taken in the past. I have also
taken an oath a loyalty to your ship. I will not break that. <br>
KARGAN: They are in conflict! <br>
RIKER: No, sir, they are not! I will obey your orders. I will serve
this ship as First Officer, and in an attack against the Enterprise I
will die along with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty
to Starfleet. <br>
KARGAN: If you had told those secrets about the Enterprise, I would
have labeled
you a traitor and killed you where you stood. But instead you will die
with us. You'll die like a Klingon. </font></p>

sub-micron form capable of breaking nuclear bonds in the tritanium
plating. <br>
PICARD: But can they be removed from the hull? <br>
MENDON: Yes. They are controllable and can be removed from the hulls of
both ships by using a tunnelling neutrino beam. <br>

RIKER: You'll get only one shot. <br>

my opinion, your reason for forcing this confrontation is not valid. <br>
