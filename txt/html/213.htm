Captain's log, stardate 45470.1. The Enterprise has been diverted to
the Moab sector to track a stellar core fragment of a
disintegrated neutron star. Our science teams have been asked to
monitor the planetary disruptions it may cause.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: We've got a problem. Our core fragment is
going to pass by Moab Four in six days. <br>
PICARD: Isn't that exactly what we anticipated? <br>
RIKER: We didn't anticipate that somebody would be living there. <br>
DATA: An artificial environment has been constructed on the southern
continent, sir. <br>
PICARD: Have you definitely established that there's someone's inside
it? <br>
DATA: Yes, Captain. Sensors are reading human life forms. <br>
PICARD: Human? <br>
RIKER: Are they responding to our hails, Mister Worf? <br>
WORF: Negative, sir. <br>
PICARD: Any starships ever reported missing in this sector, Mister
Data? <br>
DATA: No, sir. <br>
RIKER: How the hell did they find themselves on a deserted planet? <br>
LAFORGE: I'm pretty sure they know we're here. <br>
PICARD: Mister La Forge? <br>
LAFORGE: Our sensors are picking up deep EM readings. Looks like wave
patterns from an obsolete subspace relay. <br>
RIKER: Which would suggest they also have the ability to communicate
with us. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, open the lower band frequencies most commonly used
in the last century. <br>
WORF: Channel open. <br>
PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship
Enterprise. It is urgent that you respond. <br>
WORF: Sir, defensive shield around the structure is increasing in
strength. <br>
RIKER: Not exactly a welcome mat. <br>
PICARD: We mean you no harm. We must warn you that your planet is about
to experience massive seismic disruptions due to an approaching stellar
core fragment. No structure will be able to withstand them. <br>
WORF: They are responding. <br>
PICARD: On screen. <br>
CONOR [on viewscreen]: (a thirty-something man) Enterprise, I am Aaron
Conor. <br>
PICARD: Mister Conor, we were unaware that there were human colonies in
this system. <br>
CONOR [on viewscreen]: I don't want to be rude, Captain, but we don't
wish to interact with outsiders. I'm only responding because of your
warning. <br>
PICARD: The fragment will have serious effects on your planet within
six days. <br>
CONOR [on viewscreen]: Yes, I know. We have been tracking it. But our
biosphere has been constructed to withstand quakes of eight point seven
on the Richter Scale. <br>
RIKER: Mister Data? <br>
DATA: The fragment has a density of one hundred billion kilograms per
cubic centimetre. As a result, when it passes Moab Four, it will cause
tectonic shifts well beyond eight point seven on the Richter Scale. <br>
PICARD: I'm afraid we're going to have to evacuate your people. <br>
CONOR [on viewscreen]: Evacuate? That is not possible. There must be an
alternative. <br>
PICARD: Well, we will gladly explore the possibility of it with you,
Mister Conor. Would you like to come aboard to discuss it? <br>
CONOR [on viewscreen]: Our environment is sealed. No one can get in or
out. <br>
PICARD: We are capable of matter-energy transport. <br>
CONOR [on viewscreen]: Matter-energy? <br>
PICARD: We can take you directly through the structure. <br>
CONOR [on viewscreen]: Really? That's quite remarkable. <br>
PICARD: May we arrange for your transport? <br>
CONOR [on viewscreen]: No, I must stay here. But under the
circumstances, I will permit a small delegation from your ship inside
the biosphere. If only to see this matter-energy transportation you
speak of. <br>
PICARD: Very good. Commander Riker and an away team will join you
shortly. Picard out. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARTIN: (an older man) This is a mistake, Aaron. <br>
CONOR: Good Lord, Martin. What would you have me do? <br>
MARTIN: Anything that would keep them out of here. <br>
CONOR: We have nothing to hide. <br>
MARTIN: We have a great deal to lose. <br>
(transporter sound) <br>
MARTIN What is that? <br>
CONOR: It's them. Look at this, Martin. <br>
(Riker, Troi and La Forge appear) <br>
(after the credits) <br>
TROI: It's lovely I can understand why you are reluctant to leave,
Mister Conor. <br>
CONOR: Not just reluctant, Miss Troi. It is imperative that we remain. <br>
MARTIN: It would be suicide to evacuate. It would destroy everything
we've worked for two centuries to accomplish. <br>
CONOR: You see, this is an engineered society. <br>
RIKER: Engineered? <br>
CONOR: Genetically engineered. Our ancestors came from Earth to develop
a perfect society. They believed that through controlled procreation,
they could create people without flaws and those people would build a
paradise. <br>
TROI: All of you have been selectively bred? Your DNA patterns chosen? <br>
CONOR: Eight generations of us. <br>
MARTIN: We have immeasurably extended the potential of humanity,
physically, psychologically. We have evolved beyond, beyond <br>
LAFORGE: Beyond us. <br>
MARTIN: Frankly, yes. No one in this society would be blind, for
example. No offence intended. <br>
LAFORGE: I can see you just fine, sir. <br>
MARTIN: Yes. Well, my point was just. <br>
CONOR: Thank you, Martin. Perhaps you've also made it clear there are
still a few imperfections we're working on. For the most part, we've
achieved a fully integrated existence. Not just among ourselves but
with our environment. We don't just live here, we're a part of our
environment. it is part of us. Every plant life, every microscopic
lifeform is part of a master design. We cannot separate ourselves from
it without irreparably altering who and what we are. <br>
MARTIN: Your presence here has already begun to affect the entire
balance of our society. <br>
CONOR: If we do not survive, the balance of our society won't mean a
great deal, will it? <br>
(Martin leaves in a huff) <br>
CONOR: I apologise. But he is performing his function as he is designed
to do. <br>
LAFORGE: What function might that be? <br>
CONOR: He is the interpreter of our founders' intentions for this
society. <br>
RIKER: A judge? <br>
CONOR: Yes, more or less. Obviously, he has no diplomatic talents. <br>
TROI: And obviously you do. <br>
CONOR: I have been bred to fill this specific role. We grow up knowing
exactly what our society needs from us. What we are expected to do. <br>
RIKER: That must take some of fun out it? <br>
CONOR: Not at all. My entire psychological makeup tells me that I was
born to lead. I am exactly what I would choose to be.
Think of it another way. Are there still people in your society who
have not discovered who they really are, or what they were meant to do
with their lives? They may be in the wrong job, they may be writing bad
poetry. Or worse yet, they may be great poets working as labourers,
never to be discovered. That does not happen here. It is, for us, an
ideal existence. We will not give it up easily. <br>
TROI: We will do whatever we can to help you preserve it.

HANNAH: Oh yes, of course, from the starship. I've been looking forward
to speaking with you. <br>
CONOR: Hannah Bates is one of our scientists. If there's any way to
shore up our defences, Hannah will find it. She has a remarkable talent
with theoretical physics. <br>
HANNAH: I've worked up a few schematics based on gravimetric potentials
and deflector energy allocation. <br>
RIKER: Geordi, Troi and I will return to the Enterprise. When you've
reached a conclusion, you can contact us. <br>
TROI: Commander, if Mister Conor doesn't mind, I'd like to stay and see
more of his colony. <br>

disruptive? <br>
CONOR: Disruptive? You mean, what Martin was saying. <br>
TROI: Well, I certainly wouldn't wish to throw off your entire balance.
<br>
CONOR: Too late. The damage is done. <br>
TROI: Seriously. <br>
CONOR: I sometimes think that strict interpreters like Martin have
forgotten we're still human. We'll adjust, accommodate. <br>
TROI: There must be other unexpected events you have to deal with. An
untimely death, an accident. <br>
CONOR: Our geneticists are able to screen out any congenital health
risks before conception. Our population is diverse enough to maintain a
genetic balance in the event of accidental death. But very little that
is unexpected occurs here. Am I making this sound incredibly dull? <br>
TROI: Not at all. <br>
CONOR: I'll tell you the truth, but I'll deny it if you tell Martin.
I've found today exhilarating. Meeting you, meeting new people, with
new ideas. <br>
TROI: I feel the same about being here. I'm something of a student of
human nature, and I find this all fascinating. <br>
CONOR: A student of human nature? <br>
TROI: I'm the ship's Counsellor. <br>
CONOR: Ah, I'm afraid you wouldn't find much work here, Counsellor. <br>
TROI: I'd book my next vacation at your hotel, if you had one. <br>
CONOR: Well in that case, I shall have to have them build one.

withstand the tectonic shocks. The environment would be compromised. <br>
LAFORGE: That's how I see it. <br>
HANNAH: Your ship. What kind of energy output is it capable of
generating? <br>
LAFORGE: We have a matter-antimatter warp reaction system, the most
powerful in the Starfleet. Normally, it kicks plasma up into the
terawatt range. Why? <br>
HANNAH: Well, either we're going to have to move or that fragment is. <br>
LAFORGE: We can move a small moon or an asteroid, but a stellar core
fragment? That's much too massive for our tractor beam. <br>
(she calls up a diagram on a screen) <br>
LAFORGE: What's that? <br>
HANNAH: A wild idea, purely theoretical. <br>
LAFORGE: A multiphase tractor beam? <br>
HANNAH: When we first spotted the fragment approaching, I came up with
the idea, but we can't generate the kind of energy we would need. You
can.

MARTIN: No. <br>
HANNAH: With my theories and their equipment, we might be able to alter
the fragment's path. It's our only chance to avoid evacuation. <br>
CONOR: No one had ever come here and no one had ever left, until today.
This is a date to note in our history books. <br>
MARTIN: This is in direct violation of the intentions of our founders,
Aaron. <br>
CONOR: I don't think they intended us to die, Martin. <br>
MARTIN: Her absence will create an additional imbalance. <br>
CONOR: Temporarily. The circumstances require us to be flexible. <br>
MARTIN: We have no idea how molecular transport will affect her DNA. <br>
LAFORGE: It won't affect her DNA at all. There's been over a century of
evidence to prove that. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TROI: I believe some will choose to risk death
rather than leave, Captain. <br>
PICARD: You've spent a good deal of time on the surface. How do you
suggest we change their minds? <br>
TROI: I'm not sure we can. It would mean abandoning their fundamental
way of life. <br>
PICARD: They've managed to turn a dubious scientific endeavour into
dogma. <br>
TROI: You don't approve of genetic engineering. <br>
PICARD: It was a bad idea whose time is long past. <br>
TROI: They seem to have made it succeed. <br>
PICARD: They've given away their humanity with this genetic
manipulation. Many of the qualities that they breed out, the
uncertainty, the self-discovery, the unknown, those are many of the
qualities that make life worth living. Well, at least to me.
I wouldn't want to live knowing that my future was written, that my
boundaries had been already set, would you? <br>
TROI: I've asked myself that question a lot during the past few days. I
don't know. I doubt it. Nevertheless, it's what they believe in, and it
won't be an easy matter to talk them into leaving. <br>
PICARD: This leader of theirs, Conor, he seems to be a reasonable man. <br>
TROI: I find him very reasonable. Open to suggestions, thoughtful,
quite disarming. The perfect administrator. <br>
PICARD: I'm sure. Will he leave when he sees there's no other choice? <br>
TROI: I don't know. I hope so. <br>
PICARD: You admire him. <br>
TROI: Yes. <br>
PICARD: Then help him to see the reality of what may happen to his
colony. If he makes the right decision, if he's as good a leader as
he's designed to be, then perhaps the others will follow.

LAFORGE: I'll put it back on. <br>
HANNAH: Don't. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you. <br>
LAFORGE: I've never been embarrassed by this, Hannah. Never. I was born
blind. I've always been this way. <br>
HANNAH: May I see it? Your visor? <br>
LAFORGE: Sure. So, I guess if I had been conceived on your world, I
wouldn't even be here now, would I? <br>
HANNAH: No. <br>
LAFORGE: No, I'd've been terminated as a fertilised cell. <br>
HANNAH: It was the wish of our founders that no one had to suffer a
life with disabilities. <br>
LAFORGE: Who gave them the right to decide whether or not I should be
here? Whether or not I might have something to contribute. <br>
HANNAH: I don't know what to say. Here you go. How does it work? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, the visor scans the electromagnetic spectrum between one
hertz and one hundred thousand terahertz, converts it all to usable
frequencies and then transmits that information directly to my brain. <br>
HANNAH: What about the data conversion rates? How do you avoid a
sensory overload? <br>
LAFORGE: A bank of pre-processors compresses the data stream into
pulses, you see. That way, my visual cortex never. Wait a minute. Wait
just a minute. We should be able to send a high-energy pulse through
the tractor system. If it's short enough, it shouldn't overload the
emitters. The technology is right here. If we could adapt those pulse
compression routines and then apply them to the warp power conduits. <br>
HANNAH: We'd have to avoid tractor force rebounding, but that shouldn't
be hard. <br>
LAFORGE: Sure. With a few modifications. Oh, that's perfect. <br>
HANNAH: What? <br>
LAFORGE: If the answer to all of this is in a visor created for a blind
man who never would have existed in your society. No offence intended.

safe trajectory, we needed our tractor beam to be able to handle high

LAFORGE: About four times more efficient. <br>
HANNAH: And we couldn't get anywhere near that without overloading the
emitter arrays. <br>
LAFORGE: So, we added a little visor technology to the process and we
were able to boost the effective force and, at the same time, lower the
power conduit stress levels. <br>

adequate. There's definite structural damage. It appears that the
tectonic shifts created a breach. <br>
MARTIN: Can it be repaired? <br>
HANNAH: I don't know. I'll have to run a diagnostic in the lab. Unless
we seal it and fast we may have to evacuate. <br>
CONOR: How long do we have, Hannah? <br>

<br>
LAFORGE: Yeah. Amazing. <br>
HANNAH: Looks bad. It's cracked well beneath the surface. <br>
LAFORGE: Why are you doing this? <br>
HANNAH: What do you mean? <br>
LAFORGE: There's no breach. <br>
HANNAH: What are you talking about. Look at it, it's right here. I
measured the toxic leak. You saw me. <br>
LAFORGE: Hannah, my visor's positronic scan would have detected the
leak. Its molecular pattern enhancer would have picked up even the
smallest crack. <br>
HANNAH: The damn thing doesn't miss much, does it. Fine. I'll tell them
the truth. Will that make you happy? <br>
LAFORGE: Why are you doing this? <br>
HANNAH: I was born to be one of the best scientific minds of my
generation, and in the past five days I have encountered technology
that I have barely imagined. And I've got to ask myself, If we're so
brilliant how come we didn't invent any of these things? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, maybe necessity really is the mother of invention. You
never really look for something until you need it. <br>
HANNAH: But all my needs have been anticipated and planned for before
I'm even born. All of us in this colony have been living in the dark
ages. It's like we're victims of a two hundred year old joke. Until you
came, we could only see to the wall of our biosphere. Suddenly our eyes
have been opened to the infinite possibilities. </font></p>

LAFORGE: She wants to leave the colony. <br>
RIKER: She may not be the only one. The science teams that went down to
the surface fielded a lot of questions from colonists who were more
than curious about what's outside their world. <br>
WORF: Why shouldn't we grant them asylum? <br>
TROI: We can't do that. <br>
LAFORGE: We have to do that. <br>
TROI: Do you understand what it would do to the colony? <br>
LAFORGE: I understand these are human beings, Counsellor, with free
will. If she wants to leave, she has every right to. <br>
RIKER: And what happens to the colony if she does? If others join her? <br>
CRUSHER: The society is genetically integrated. Suddenly there would be
gaps, missing pieces. <br>
TROI: It would destroy them. <br>
CRUSHER: There must be something we can do to help. <br>
PICARD: We may have done too much to help them already, Doctor. <br>
WORF: We saved them from destruction. <br>
PICARD: Did we? Counsellor, I think it's time you took me to meet
Mister Conor.

TROI: Computer, halt. Captain, I have to tell you something, and it
isn't easy for me because I've used very poor judgement. Actually, I've
acted quite unprofessionally. <br>
PICARD: Counsellor, what is it you say? Take a deep breath. <br>
TROI: Conor and I have had a relationship. <br>
PICARD: I see. <br>
TROI: It should never have happened. I knew there was concern about
outside influences and I should have been more careful. <br>
PICARD: What is your status with him now? <br>
TROI: I did not intend to see him again. <br>
PICARD: Would you prefer not to return to the surface? <br>
TROI: No, I think I should come with you, but I wanted you to know
before we went down. <br>
PICARD: I appreciate that. Computer, resume. <br>
TROI: I wanted so much to help him, to be there for him, but the more I
was. <br>
PICARD: Deanna, we all went into this with the best intentions. <br>
TROI: I should have walked away as soon as I saw what was happening. <br>

manipulation or not, nobody's perfect.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARTIN: You would ignore the welfare of the colony
for your own selfish interests. <br>
HANNAH: The welfare of this colony would be best served by rejoining
the human race. <br>
MARTIN: She has been contaminated by the people on that ship. <br>
(Troi and Picard enter) <br>
TROI: Aaron. <br>
PICARD: Mister Conor, I believe that you and I should talk. <br>
MARTIN: This is your doing. We should never have answered your hails. <br>
HANNAH: If we'd followed that advice, Martin, we'd all be dead by now.
So much for the welfare of this colony. <br>
MARTIN: You are not taking her with you. <br>
HANNAH: I'm leaving. And I'll tell you something else. There are at
least a dozen others who are ready to go with me. <br>
TROI: Hannah, let's allow Aaron and Captain Picard to discuss this. Why
don't we go for a walk? <br>
HANNAH: There's nothing else for them to talk about. <br>
(Hannah and Troi leave) <br>
CONOR: Martin. <br>
MARTIN: I think it would be helpful if I. <br>
CONOR: I want to talk with Captain Picard alone. <br>
MARTIN: But <br>
CONOR: Thank you, Martin. <br>
)Martin leaves) <br>
CONOR: The irony is, he's the one who saw this coming from the moment
you arrived. Because I didn't want to hear it, I chose not to listen. <br>
PICARD: You made decisions you felt would save your colony. <br>
CONOR: No. No, I wish it were that simple, but I can't forgive myself
so easily. You see, Captain, I know what Hannah Bates is feeling. I've
been feeling it as well. I've found your people intriguing and
stimulating as she has. I've been every bit as curious about you as the
next man. But I am not the next man. I am the leader of these people.
And every genetic fibre in my being demands that I protect them.
Instead, I have betrayed them. I have allowed this to happen. <br>
PICARD: We have both allowed this to happen. <br>
CONOR: Then let us both find a way to stop it from going any further. <br>
PICARD: I wish I could see a way. <br>
CONOR: Picard, I was born to govern this colony, not to dismantle it. <br>
PICARD: If you force them to stay, you will be suppressing their human
rights. <br>
CONOR: If even a handful leave, the damage to this society will be
devastating. What about the rights of those who would stay behind? They
are the ones who will inherit the social chaos that will follow for
generations. Your arrival created this problem. Your departure solves
it. <br>
PICARD: That is simplistic. <br>
CONOR: Refuse them passage. <br>
PICARD: I cannot ignore the requests of people, humans, who ask for
transport away from here. <br>
CONOR: Nor can you ignore the fact that thousands will suffer if you
agree to take them. And as suffering grows, more will demand to leave.
We are witnessing the end of this existence. I implore you, Captain, do
not let this happen. <br>
PICARD: You would have me make the decision for you, nut I can't do
that. I am willing to talk to these people with you, and I will urge
them not to make an impulsive choice, but if finally they choose to
leave, the Enterprise will not turn them away. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CONOR: Captain Picard has decided to grant
transport to any individuals who wish to leave Genome Colony. I'm
asking you to stay. <br>
HANNAH: Aaron, don't you see we can't be happy here any longer? We were
innocent. it will never be that way again. <br>
CONOR: The experiences of the past week will become part of our
heritage. We will adjust. In a few generations, we will be able to <br>
HANNAH: We're not willing to stay here a few generations. <br>
CONOR: Give me six months. Just wait six months before you leave. <br>
HANNAH: What will that accomplish? <br>
PICARD: It's true that our presence here has had an unintended
influence on your society. But it's done and there
is no way to undo it. But feelings are running very high. Perhaps it's
not such a bad idea that you should take adequate time to weigh
carefully the consequences of what you're about to do. We are prepared
to return in six months. <br>
HANNAH: In other words, we are being asked to stay here for six months
while they pressure us to change our minds. <br>
PICARD: In five days, you have seen only the most superficial evidence
of what life is like outside this biosphere. <br>
HANNAH: Would you ever choose to live aboard a ship in a bottle,
Captain? You are in command of a starship. You live to explore the
unknown. We ask for that same privilege. <br>
CONOR: Hannah, this is your home. We are all, in a sense, your family.
Don't we deserve an opportunity to open a dialogue on this issue at the
very least? I am only asking for six months. <br>
HANNAH: It won't make any difference. You'll only be putting the people
of this colony through unnecessary pain and anguish. <br>
MARTIN: You are the ones who are causing pain and anguish in this
colony. You. <br>
HANNAH: Don't you see, Aaron? It's over. It's time for you to lead our
people into a new era. You could come with us. <br>
CONOR: When you're ready to come home, you will be welcome. <br>
(Later) <br>
TROI: What will you do now? <br>
CONOR: Attempt to assess the damage. Spend the rest of my life on the
near impossible task of rebuilding this society without the proper
pieces. <br>
TROI: Aaron, you acted in the best interests of your people. There was
no way to avoid what happened. <br>
CONOR: I replay each step of this in my mind, looking for the wrong
turn, the mistake in judgement. I can find only one. And as hard as I
try, I cannot regret even that one. In fact, I'm quite certain that,
given the opportunity, I would choose to
make the same mistake again. I can only wonder why, with all the
hundreds of genetically compatible women, I would fall in love with
you. <br>
TROI: Don't say that. <br>
CONOR: Perhaps it's your imperfections which make you so unique. But I
am in love with you, Deanna Troi, and I will always be.
