LAFORGE: Yeah, sure, Data. Everybody does from time to time. <br>
DATA: I have had one hundred eleven dreams since I first discovered
this programme
nine months ago. In all of that time, I have never experienced such
strange and disturbing imagery. I believe it was a nightmare. <br>
LAFORGE: Nightmares are part of dreaming, Data. Maybe you've just
discovered another new level to your
programme. <br>
DATA: Perhaps. I have also noted that I am spending an inordinate
amount of time thinking about nightmare imagery. One could almost say I
am preoccupied. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, it's perfectly normal, Data. Sometimes when I have a
nightmare, I can't shake that weird feeling for a couple of days. <br>
TYLER: Commander La Forge? <br>
LAFORGE: Speaking of nightmares. <br>
TYLER: (a petite dark lady) I just finished recalibrating the starboard
EPS module. <br>

TYLER: It's just like you said. Reset the power tap and the module came
right online. You have such a wonderful grasp of engineering
principles. I'm learning so much just by being around you. <br>
LAFORGE: I'll tell you what. Why don't you help Farrell check the
deuterium cartridges. I'm just about to bring the warp core online. All

DATA: I do not understand. <br>
LAFORGE: She's got a crush on me, Data. <br>
DATA: You do not share her affection? <br>
LAFORGE: Exactly. And quite frankly, it's beginning to get a little bit
uncomfortable. <br>

hurting Ensign Tyler's feelings. <br>

when the doorbell rings) <br>
DATA: Enter. <br>
TROI: Hello, Data. <br>
DATA: Counsellor. <br>
TROI: What are you doing? <br>
DATA: I have been watching Spot sleep. In the past fifteen minutes, he
has had twelve muscles spasms, which indicates he was dreaming. I have
often wondered what Spot dreams about. His twitching and his rapid
breathing would seem to suggest anxiety, but Spot has never seen a
mouse or any other form of rodentia. He has never encountered an
insect, or been chased by a canine. <br>
TROI: I understand you've had some interesting dreams recently. Geordi
was worried about you and he wanted me to check in and see how you were
doing. <br>
DATA: That was very thoughtful of him. I've been debating whether or
not to initiate another dream sequence. <br>
TROI: Because of the nightmares? <br>
DATA: I have found them to be quite unsettling. <br>
TROI: Data, you shouldn't be afraid of dark imagery in your dreams.
It's a natural expression of your unconscious, if you have an
unconscious. I'm not really sure how your positronic brain works but if
it's anything like ours, then there's part of you that's trying to
express itself through your dream state. And I think you should allow
yourself to experience it. As Sigmund Freud said, dreams are the royal
road to the knowledge of the mind. <br>
DATA: Thank you, Counsellor. I believe I will initiate a dream
programme now. <br>
TROI: Let me know how it goes. Goodnight, Data. <br>

LAFORGE: You know, Data, there's an awful lot we don't know about your
dream programme. Maybe it was designed to cause side effects. I mean,
for all we know, Doctor Soong might have intended for you to oversleep
from time to time. It's part of the human experience. <br>

there are no anomalies in my neural net. <br>

Counsellor. <br>
DATA: It had a black handle and a serrated blade, and it was quite
long. <br>
FREUD: How long? <br>
DATA: Twenty five centimetres in length. <br>
FREUD: And what happened next? <br>
DATA: One of the workmen pointed to her right shoulder. At that moment,
I had an overwhelming urge to cut a piece out of the cake. <br>
FREUD: And did you? <br>
DATA: Yes. As I began slicing the cake, she reacted as though I was
causing her pain. Yet I could not stop cutting. That is when I woke up.
Doctor Freud, I am curious. <br>
(Data starts to sit up from the couch and is gestured to lie down
again) <br>
DATA: I am curious. What do my nightmares mean? <br>
FREUD: I believe you are experiencing a classic dismemberment dream. Or
in your case, being a mechanical man, a dismantlement dream. <br>
DATA: I do not understand. <br>
FREUD: Your mechanistic qualities are trying to reassert themselves
over your human tendencies. Ego and id struggling for domination. The
workmen symbolise the ever present id constantly working to destroy the
ego. Now the image of Counsellor Troi, a female, is devoured by you,
clearly indicating an unconscious desire to possess your own mother. <br>
DATA: But I do not have a mother. <br>
FREUD: Do not interrupt. The knife in its violent connotation suggests
a certain feeling of sexual inadequacy. <br>
DATA: but I have no sexual desire. <br>
FREUD: Ach! Impotence on top of everything. It is all becoming clear to
me now. There might be a paper in this. <br>
DATA: I do not believe I am being helped by this session. <br>
FREUD: Classic transference. Your anger toward me is, in fact, the
animosity you feel toward your father. You are a polymorphously
perverse individual, Mister Data, and I recommend full psychoanalysis.
I believe I can fit you in next Tuesday. <br>

WORF: Your animal? <br>

WORF: Of course. Spot, come here. <br>
DATA: Unlike a canine, Spot does not respond to verbal commands. (hands
him to Worf who holds him at arms length) Goodbye, Spot. He will need
to be fed once a day. He prefers feline supplement number twenty five. <br>
WORF: I understand. <br>
DATA: And he will require water. And you must provide him with a sand
box. And you must talk to him. Tell him he is a pretty cat, and a good
cat. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: Captain, we have a problem. Take a look at
this. Her tissue is breaking down on a cellular level and it's
spreading. At first I thought it was a rash from the coil brace she was
stabbed with, but when I used the interphasic scanner, I found this. <br>
(a blue light shows a creature eating Troi's skin) <br>
PICARD: What is it? <br>
CRUSHER: The question is, what are they? <br>
(there's one on her own arm) <br>
CRUSHER: I've tested all the medical staff and I've found them on
almost everyone so far. The cellular decay is accelerating in all
cases. I haven't found a way to stop it or even slow it down. (there's
one on Riker's temple) Looks like you're infected too. The organisms
appear to be attached to our epidermal layers with osmotic tendrils.
They're tapping directly into the bloodstream. (Picard has one on his
throat) And from what I can tell, they're spreading. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Observation Lounge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: What are we dealing with here? Are these
creatures feeding on us? <br>
CRUSHER: Yes, in a very particular way. They appear to be extracting
our cellular peptides. It's roughly analogous to the way terran leeches
consume haemoglobin. If they're not removed soon, our bodies are going
to lose all their cellular cohesion. We'll collapse into nothing but a
few pounds of chemicals. <br>
PICARD: All right. Is there any way that we can affect these organisms?
<br>
LAFORGE: We've tried EM radiation, subspace fields, thermal protons,
nothing's worked. They seem to exist in some sort of interphasic state,
just beyond our range of visual and sensor acuity. The only way we can
see them is to use an IP scanner. Tricorders can't even pick them up. <br>
RIKER: Do we know where these things came from, Mister Worf? <br>
WORF: I scanned the vicinity with an IP scanner. There is no sign of
any similar creatures, or any unusual interphasic activity. <br>
PICARD: What about Mister Data? There must be some connection between
his odd behaviour and these creatures. Is he infested as well? <br>
CRUSHER: No. I scanned him, but I found nothing. <br>
PICARD: Data attacked Counsellor Troi because he saw a mouth on her
shoulder. And in that same area that we first saw one of the organisms.
<br>
RIKER: Data also saw a straw in my head and then Beverly discovered an
organism in the same place. <br>
LAFORGE: Those images are all part of Data's dream. Maybe somehow he's
unconsciously perceiving these creatures. <br>
PICARD: Then perhaps it is time that we took a closer look at Mister
Data's dreams.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Data's quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: It is an interesting hypothesis. If I am
being affected by these interphasic creatures on an unconscious level,
it may also explain my waking dreams, and my subsequent anti-social
behaviour. <br>
LAFORGE: What we want to do, Data, is link your neural net into the
holodeck and have you activate your dream
programme, so as you dream we can observe the dream images. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps we can learn more about these creatures by interpreting
the symbols and images of your dreams. <br>
DATA: I see. The concept is similar to the method of directed dreaming.
<br>
PICARD: Exactly. How soon can you have the link ready? <br>
LAFORGE: We'd need about an hour to establish all the interface
parameters. <br>
PICARD: Make it so. In the meantime, Mister Data, I suggest that you
should prepare for bed.

has been calibrated to Data's neural net. <br>

bad dreams would be more helpful. <br>

PICARD: Here he comes. <br>
DATA: Hello. <br>
PICARD: Can we speak to Data directly or would that wake him up? <br>
LAFORGE: He should be perceiving us as just another part of his dream.
Anything we say to him will be taken in that context. <br>

the same place that Data stabbed her. <br>
LAFORGE: In his waking dream he said that there was a mouth on her
shoulder. <br>
PICARD: They're both symbols of consumption. Mouth, food. Mister Data,
what kind of cake is this? <br>
DATA: It is cellular peptide cake. <br>
WORF: With mint frosting. <br>
LAFORGE: Cellular peptides. That's exactly what the creatures are
extracting. <br>
RIKER: Will someone answer that damn ringing! Captain, the ringing is
getting worse. <br>
PICARD: What could the ringing symbolise? A bell? Sound? An
old-fashioned way of communicating? <br>
CRUSHER: Do you want some? It's delicious. <br>

FREUD: If I were to interpret my own appearance in this dream, I would
say I am the symbolic representation of Data's unconscious mind trying
to warn him about the dangers he perceives around him. <br>
PICARD: You mean the interphasic organisms. <br>
FREUD: Of course. <br>
PICARD: Tell me, Doctor, how do we kill them? <br>

on. It's the plasma conduit we installed with the new warp core. <br>

PICARD: Data, what's going on? <br>
DATA: The workmen in my dreams represent the organisms which are trying
to demolish the ship. The incessant ringing of the telephone, Freud's
cautions at the other end, were warnings of the dangers around us. <br>
PICARD: What about the shrieking noises that you made? <br>
DATA: My positronic subprocessor detected high frequency interphasic
signatures from the organisms, which were symbolically represented in
my dreams by a high shriek. <br>
PICARD: When you made those noises, the workmen reacted in pain. <br>
DATA: That is why I have asked Geordi to adjust my subprocessor. If I
can produce a high frequency interphasic pulse, it may have a similar
effect on the creatures. <br>

Seven using a new interphasic fusion process. We think it was that
process which attracted the organisms to the conduit where they lay
dormant until we activated the warp core. That's also why we couldn't
get the core online. The creatures were disrupting the plasma flow. <br>
PICARD: How long before we have warp power again? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, we're going to have to manufacture a new conduit. That's
at least six hours work. <br>

very unfortunate. <br>
