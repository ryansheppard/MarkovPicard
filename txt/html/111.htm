Captain's log, stardate 41590.5. Having dropped off Counsellor Troi at
Starbase G6 for a shuttle to visit home, we were fortunately close to
the Sigma Three solar system when its Federation colony transmitted an
urgent call for medical help. An accidental explosion has devastated a
mining operation there. </font>

where a group of badly injured <br>

impressed. We have much to discuss, including perhaps the realisation
of your most impossible dream. <br>

such. <br>

find this all very amusing. <br>

dying humans who <br>
Q: Your species is always suffering and dying. <br>
PICARD: No, Lieutenant Worf. You'll make no move against him unless I
order it. <br>
Q: Pity. You might have learned an interesting lesson. Macro head with
a micro brain. <br>
PICARD: You said you had the realisation of impossible dreams to offer
us. When this rescue is completed, I am prepared to listen carefully to
whatever proposal you wish to make and subject to it being acceptable <br>
Q: Subject to your foolish human values? Oh, come, Picard. Why do you
distrust me so? <br>
PICARD: Why? At our first meeting you seized my vessel. You condemned
all humans as savages, and on that charge you tried us in a post-atomic
twenty first century court of horrors, where you attacked my people.
You again seized my vessel. <br>
Q: And that angered you, did it? Seized my vessel, seized my vessel. <br>
PICARD: You interfered with our Farpoint mission. You threatened to
convict us as ignorant savages, if, while dealing with a powerful and
complex life forms, we made the slightest mistake, and when that didn't
happen <br>
Q: The Q became interested in you. Does no one here understand your
incredible good fortune? Seized my vessel. These are the complaints of
a closed mind too accustomed to military privileges. But you, Riker,
and I remember you well, what do you make of my offer? <br>
RIKER: We don't have time for these games. <br>
Q: Games? Did someone say games? And perchance for interest's sake, a
deadly game? To the game.<br>

(It's Q, in a French uniform complete with tricorn hat and tricolor
cockade) <br>
Q: Join me, Riker. A good game needs rules and planning. Wasn't it your
own Hartley who said, nothing reveals humanity so well as the games it
plays? Almost right. Actually, you reveal yourselves best in how you
play. <br>
DATA: Sir, what he has in mind might provide us with vital information.
<br>
(Riker joins Q at a table in front of a tent. He picks up a glass to
drink) <br>
RIKER: Incredible. I was just thinking about an old-fashioned lemonade.
<br>
Q: And so it became that. An excellent thirst quencher. It gets rather
hot out on this plain. <br>
RIKER: What about my people? <br>
Q: Whatever they'd like, of course! <br>
(Glasses appear in everyone's hands. Worf ostentatiously pours his onto
the ground) <br>
Q: Drink not with thine enemy. The rigid Klingon code. That explains
something of why you defeated them. <br>
RIKER: You're still fascinated with the human past? Perhaps you're not
that original. <br>
Q: Au contraire! It's the human future which intrigues us, and should
concern you most. You see, of all species, yours cannot abide
stagnation. Change is at the heart of what you are. But change into
what? That's the question. <br>
DATA: That is what humans call a truism. <br>
Q: You mean hardly original? <br>
RIKER: You're the one who said it. While we're at it, this isn't part
of any human future. <br>
Q: True. I borrowed this from your stodgy Captain's mind. This is
dressing for a game that we will play. Now games require rules and
rewards and
dangers and familiar settings. That sort of thing. <br>
RIKER: This isn't that familiar to me. Data? <br>
DATA: This is from Europe's Napoleonic era, sir. Late eighteenth, early
nineteenth centuries. This is a campaign headquarters tent, his uniform
is that of a French Army marshal. <br>
RIKER: And a marshal outranks even an Admiral <br>
Q: Well, do you think I would go from a Starfleet Admiral to anything
else? <br>
RIKER: Of course you wouldn't. But Napoleonic equipment on an alien
planet. One so different it has twin moons? <br>
Q: Well, as you said, I'm nothing if not imaginative. And the game
should reflect that. Shall it be a test of strength? Meaningless, since
you have none. A test of intelligence, then? Equally as meaningless.
But it needs risk, something to win and something to lose. <br>
RIKER: If we must play a game, what would we win? <br>
Q: The greatest possible future that you can imagine. Which, of course,
requires something totally disastrous if you lose. Now the point of
this game shall be, can any of you can stay alive? <br>
WORF: If your game is fair, we will. <br>
Q: Oh, for shame, Worf. Fairness is such a human concept. Think
imaginatively! This game shall in fact be completely unfair. <br>
TASHA: You've gone too far! <br>
Q: Game penalty! <br>
(Tasha vanishes) <br>
RIKER: Where is she, Q? You can forget your game if <br>
Q: To use a twentieth century term, she's in a penalty box. Where she
will remain unharmed unless one of you merits a penalty. Unfortunately,
there is only one penalty box. If any of you should be sent there, dear
Tasha must give the box up to you. <br>
LAFORGE: And where does she go? <br>
Q: Into nothingness. I entreat you to carefully obey the rules of the
game. The only one who can destroy your Tasha now is you.

you're what? You're only human? Penalty over. <br>
PICARD: A marshal of France? Ridiculous! <br>
Q: One takes what jobs he can get. For example, star log entry,
stardate today. This is Q, speaking for Captain Jean-Luc Picard, who we
consider too bound by Starfleet customs and traditions to be useful to
us. The Enterprise is now helpless, stuck like an Earth insect in amber
while its bridge crew plays out a game whose real intent is to test
whether the First Officer is worthy of the greatest gift the Q can
offer. <br>
PICARD: So you're taking on Riker this time. Excellent. He'll defeat
you just as I did. <br>
Q: Shall we wager on that, Captain? Your starship command against? <br>

Q: Concern regarding them. <br>
PICARD: Whatever it is, why do you demonstrate it through this
confrontation? Why not a simple, direct explanation, a statement of
what you seek? Why these games? <br>
Q: Why these games? Why, the play's the thing. And I'm surprised you
have to ask when your human Shakespeare explained it all so well. <br>
PICARD: So he did, but don't depend too much on any single viewpoint <br>
Q: It's a pity you don't know the content of your own library. Hear
this, Picard, and reflect. All the galaxy's a stage. <br>
PICARD: World, not galaxy. All the world's a stage. <br>
Q: Oh, you know that one? Well, if he were living now he would have
said galaxy. How about this? Life is but a walking shadow, a poor
player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard
no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing. <br>
PICARD: I see. So how we respond to a game tells you more about us than
our real life, this tale told by an idiot? Interesting, Q. <br>
Q: Oh, thank you very much. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Perhaps maybe a
little Hamlet? <br>
PICARD: Oh, no. I know Hamlet. And what he might said with irony, I say
with conviction. What a piece of work is man. How noble in reason. How
infinite in faculty. In form, in moving, how express and admirable. In
action, how like an angel. In apprehension, how like a god. <br>

sir. But it is hardly a weapon by our standards. A lead ball propelled
by gunpowder. One hundred metres at best with any accuracy. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, but against phasers? Just one of our hand phasers could
finish off an entire regiment. <br>

advantage like that. Unless. <br>

Q: The limitless dimensions of the galaxy in which we exist. <br>

Q: Of course you don't, and you never will until you become one of us. <br>
RIKER: Until? Would you mind going over that again? <br>
Q: Well if you'll stop interrupting me. This is hardly a time to be
teaching you the true nature of the universe. However, at Farpoint we
saw you as savages only. We discovered instead that you are unusual
creatures in your own limited ways. Ways which in time will not be so
limited. <br>
RIKER: We're growing. Something about us compels us to learn, explore. <br>
Q: Yes, the human compulsion. And unfortunately for us, it is a power
which will grow stronger century after century, aeon after aeon. <br>
RIKER: Aeons. Have you any idea how far we'll advance? <br>
Q: Perhaps in a future that you cannot yet conceive, even beyond us. So
you see, we must know more about this human condition. That's why we've
selected you, Riker, to become part of the Q, so that you can bring to
us this human need and hunger, that we may understand it. <br>

crew. <br>
PICARD: And when you grow to like it too much? <br>
RIKER: As soon as it's convenient Captain, I want a meeting with you
and your Bridge staff. <br>
PICARD: As soon as we are secure of this rescue operation, I'll discuss
all of this new power <br>
(But Riker has already gone to the turbolift) <br>
(Later, Riker returns) <br>
PICARD: We can confer here on the Bridge, if no one has any objections.
<br>
RIKER: The Bridge will be fine, since I've called the entire staff. <br>
PICARD: Correction, Number One. Knowing the decision you face, I have
permitted you this gathering. <br>
RIKER: Of course, Jean-Luc. <br>
(Crusher and Wesley enter) <br>
RIKER: Wesley, this meeting is not for you. <br>
WESLEY: Why not, sir? You helped make me a Bridge officer. Acting
Ensign. <br>
RIKER: All right, he stays. Because I've been given unusual powers, I
am not suddenly a monster. Except for these abilities, and I don't yet
know how far they go, I'm the same William T. Riker you've always
known. Well? Everyone still looks uncomfortable. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps they're all remembering that old saying. Power
corrupts. <br>
RIKER: And absolute power corrupts absolutely. Do you believe I haven't
thought of that, Jean-Luc? <br>
PICARD: And have you noticed how you and I are now on a first name
basis? Number One, Will, something has happened already. <br>
RIKER: In what way? Haven't you seen how much I regretted not saving
that child? Using the Q power to save her may not have been wrong. No
more than it was wrong to save the rest of you from those soldier
things. <br>
PICARD: Let's keep in mind that that particular danger was invented by
Q. <br>
TASHA: What we represent to the Q, Commander, are lowly animals,
tormented into performing for their amusement. <br>
RIKER: Actually, they think highly of us, Tasha. We have a quality of
growth which they admire. <br>
LAFORGE: Or fear. <br>
PICARD: No, we've learned the Q do not admire us. The Q has muddled
your mind. <br>
RIKER: Don't you understand his incredible gift to me? <br>
Q: Are these truly your friends, brother? <br>
(Everyone turns to see Q in a monk's habit) <br>
Q: Let us pray. For understanding and for compassion. <br>
PICARD: Let us do no such damned thing! What is this need of yours for
costumes, Q? Have you no identity of your own? <br>
Q: I come in search of the truth. <br>
PICARD: You come in search of what humanity is! <br>
Q: I forgive your blasphemy. <br>
PICARD: Don't you see, Riker? He's nothing but a flim-flam man! He's
been that ever since we first met him at Farpoint. <br>
WORF: Flim-flam? <br>
Q: You offer Riker jealousy. What I offer him is clearly beyond your
comprehension. How can you claim friendship for Riker while obstructing
his way to the greatest adventure ever offered a human? <br>
PICARD: Obstructing him? Then it's not yet certain. He's not yet
committed. <br>
Q: The truly evil part of this, Captain, is your jealousy. (to Riker)
You love each one of your people. Demonstrate it. You have the power to
leave each of them with a gift proving your affection. <br>
RIKER: There'd be no harm, would there, if I gave them something I know
they'd like? <br>
Q: How touching. A plea to his former Captain. May I please give some
happiness to my friends, sir? Please sir? <br>
PICARD: In fact I authorise and support your idea, Riker. Please, feel
free to cooperate with him if you wish. <br>
DATA: Are you certain, sir? <br>
PICARD: Quite certain, Data. By all means, demonstrate your gifts of
affection. <br>
RIKER: Don't be frightened. There is no way I could harm any of you.
Shall I guess your dreams? <br>
CRUSHER: Leave now, Wesley. <br>
RIKER: No! Wesley, I may know best of all. Our friendship, our long
talks <br>
CRUSHER: No, please! <br>
RIKER: Have your favourite wish, my young friend. <br>
(Wesley is transformed from teenager to hunk) <br>
RIKER: You're ten years older. A man. <br>
LAFORGE: Hey, Wes. Not bad. <br>
RIKER: Data. <br>
DATA: No. No, sir. <br>
RIKER: But it's what you've always wanted, Data, to become human. <br>
DATA: Yes, sir, that is true. But I never wanted to compound one
illusion with another. It might be real to Q, perhaps even you, sir.
But it would not be so to me. Was it not one of the Captain's favourite
authors who wrote, This above all, to thine own self be true? Sorry,
Commander, I must decline. <br>
RIKER: Well, my friend, I know what you want. <br>
(He waves his hand in front of Geordi and takes off the visor) <br>
LAFORGE: (to Tasha) You're as beautiful as I imagined, and more. <br>
RIKER: Then we can throw away the visor? <br>
LAFORGE: I don't think so, sir. The price is a little high for me, and
I don't like who I would have to thank. Make me the way I was. Please! <br>
(Riker does) <br>
RIKER: Proud warrior Worf, without a single tie to his own kind. <br>
(A Klingon woman is kneeling at his feet. She gets up, tries to swipe
at Tasha, and gets knocked down by Worf) <br>
WORF: No! She is from a world now alien to me! <br>
LAFORGE: Worf, is this your idea of sex? <br>
WORF: This is sex. But I have no place for it in my life now. <br>
Q: No place, micro-brain? What possesses you? <br>
WESLEY: Commander Riker, it's too soon for this. <br>
RIKER: If this is because your mother objects? <br>
WESLEY: No. I just want to get there on my own. Honest. <br>
Q: But it's easier, boy. Listen to Riker. <br>
RIKER: How did you know, sir? I feel like such an idiot. <br>
PICARD: Quite right. So you should. It's all over, Q. You have no
further business here. <br>
Q: Human, you have just destroyed yourself. <br>
PICARD: Pay off your wager. <br>
Q: I recall no wager! <br>
PICARD: I'm sure your fellow Q remember you agreed to never trouble our
species again. Just as they're aware you failed to tempt a human to
join you. <br>
Q: (to the ceiling) No, if I could just do one more thing. <br>
PICARD: Q, I strongly suspect it's some explaining you have to do now. <br>
(Q screams as he disappears. Wesley returns to gangly teenager, the
Klingon woman vanishes and everyone is moved to new positions) <br>
PICARD: Extraordinary! <br>
LAFORGE: Captain, we are showing that same hole in time again. Our
instruments say we've just now beamed back from our rescue mission. <br>
DATA: Sir, how is it that the Q can handle time and space so well, and
us so badly? <br>
PICARD: Perhaps some day we will discover that space and time are
simpler than the human equation. No coordinates laid in, Number One? <br>
RIKER: Yes, sir. You have my coordinates, La Forge. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. On the board. <br>
PICARD: Engage. </font> </p>
