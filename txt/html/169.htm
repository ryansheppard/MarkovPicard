unsatisfactory rating for one of my crew. <br>
RIKER: I guess the issue is whether Mister Barclay is Enterprise
material. <br>
PICARD: I assume from your request for his transfer that you think he's
not, Commander. <br>
LAFORGE: I hate to say it but, I always thought I could work with
anybody. But I just don't understand this guy. Broccoli makes me
nervous, Captain. He makes everybody nervous. <br>
PICARD: Broccoli? <br>
RIKER: Young Mister Crusher started that. I guess it's caught on. <br>
PICARD: Let's just get that uncaught, shall we? There's every
indication he's served competently in Starfleet for years. His ratings
aboard the Zhukov were satisfactory. In fact I recall Captain Gleason
speaking quite highly of him before his transfer. <br>
RIKER: In retrospect, I wonder if Captain Gleason wasn't buttering our
bread a little. He knew we were looking for a diagnostic engineer. I've
examined Barclay's psychological profile. He's a history of seclusive
tendencies. It was noted at the Academy more than once. <br>
PICARD: And yet he chose this way of life. He has made the same
commitment to Starfleet that we all have. It's easy to transfer a
problem to someone else. Too easy. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain, it's not like I haven't tried. <br>
PICARD: Try harder, Geordi. He's a member of your team. Try to find
some way to help him to make a positive contribution. Get to know the
man better. Make him your best friend. <br>
LAFORGE: With all respect, sir, my best friend? I can barely tolerate
being in the same room with the man. <br>

let's do it. Has anybody seen Lieutenant Barclay? <br>
DUFFY: Not yet, sir. <br>
LAFORGE: Okay. <br>
(Barclay arrives) <br>
LAFORGE: Okay. This trip to Nahmi Four is pretty routine, so we'll have
plenty of time to realign the magnetic capacitors on both the matter
and anti-matter injectors. Duffy, Costa, that'll be your assignment. <br>
DUFFY: We probably ought to do the flow regulator maintenance at the
same time, Commander. <br>
LAFORGE: That's a good idea. Ensign Crusher will putting in some hours
with us this week as part of his training duties, so I'll be assigning
him to assist you, Mister Myers. Be sure and teach him the difference
between impulse and warp drive, please. Lieutenant Barclay has working
on the mystery of the anti-grav failure we had yesterday. Your
preliminary report had a couple
of interesting theories, Reg. Why don't you bring us all up to speed on
your findings so far. <br>
BARCLAY: Yes. It wasn't a maintenance problem. Everything checked out.
I, I'm going to check for a surge in the transfer coils. <br>
WESLEY: A coil surge wouldn't have resulted in field dissipation. <br>
BARCLAY: I, I, I realise that <br>
LAFORGE: But we shouldn't ignore the possibilities, Wes. <br>
WESLEY: You ought to check the flow capacitor. A breakdown of that
could have caused a chain collapse of the antigrav fields. <br>
BARCLAY: I, I was going to. <br>
LAFORGE: Good. Okay, then let's go over the realignment procedure.

seventeen year old kid. <br>

has been altered at the atomic level. <br>
LAFORGE: A problem with the replicator? <br>
DATA: Unlikely. A problem with the replicator would have affected the
contents as well as the glass. But the liquid in the glass was a
synthehol replication of a light ale of Earth origin, which is, I
believe what Lieutenant Duffy ordered. <br>
LAFORGE: I can't detect any residual radiation or unusual chemical
compounds that would have caused this. <br>
DATA: The most probable explanation is that the glass came into contact
with an unshielded power source. <br>
LAFORGE: That means a complete diagnostic check of the Enterprise power
systems. All four thousand of them. Do I have the perfect man for this
job. Hey, Reg. Busy? <br>
BARCLAY: Well, I was just. No, not really. Why? <br>
LAFORGE: I've got another mystery for you. Somehow the molecular
structure of this cup from Ten Forward has been altered. We need to run
through the power systems to see if there's a leak that caused this. <br>
BARCLAY: I had, I was going to do that. <br>
LAFORGE: You were? <br>
BARCLAY: Yes. To, to try to explain the anti-grav unit failure. I still
can't. Nothing about it makes sense. <br>

related.

troubling him. You know, there's nothing wrong with a healthy fantasy
