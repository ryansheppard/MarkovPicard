come on board. This telepathic species has no concept of spoken
language, and is being instructed in its use by an old friend.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LWAXANA: (in brown, almost drab for her) I don't
know what they'd have done without me. First, I had to learn how they
communicate. It was an absolutely exhausting process. <br>
PICARD: It must have been. <br>
LWAXANA: Quite different from Betazed telepathy. We transmit words.
With the Cairn, it's images. A flood of them all at the same time. It's
overwhelming. <br>
PICARD: I can imagine. <br>
LWAXANA: Actually it's a very efficient way of communicating. If two
Cairn were having this conversation it would have been over minutes
ago. <br>
PICARD: Really? <br>
LWAXANA: Of course, they realise that they'll want to communicate
verbally if they join the Federation. Do me a favour. Introduce
yourself to one of them. Engage him in conversation. They need the
practice. <br>
PICARD: I'd be happy to. <br>
LAFORGE: It's called a visor. It enables me to see. <br>
HEDRIL: (a little girl) Like my vocal enhancer. It helps me make
sounds. <br>
LWAXANA: I see you've already met my star pupil. Hedril's picked up
spoken language much faster than the others. <br>
DATA: It is often the case that children learn languages more easily
than adults. <br>
LWAXANA: Deanna was quite good at languages when she was little. Where
is Deanna? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, she must be here somewhere. <br>
LWAXANA: Hedril, darling. <br>
(Lwaxana has what looks like a dizzy turn) <br>
HEDRIL: What? <br>
LWAXANA: Go find your father, dear. I want to talk to him. <br>
DATA: Mrs Troi? <br>
LWAXANA: Yes yes just a little tired. This constant telepathy with the
Cairn. I'm fine, really. Aren't you going to mingle, Mister Woof? <br>
WORF: I do not care for telepaths. They make me uneasy. <br>
LWAXANA: Don't worry. The Cairn couldn't read your thoughts even if
they wanted to. Your brain isn't sophisticated enough. (to Riker)
Neither is yours, dear. They can only communicate with other telepaths.
Have either of you seen Deanna? <br>
RIKER: She was working, but she said she would be (doors open) Speak of
the devil. <br>
TROI: Sorry I'm late. I lost track of the time. <br>
LWAXANA: Deanna, dear, come with me. I want you to meet the senior
diplomat of the Cairn delegation. Maques, this is the beautiful
daughter I've been telling you about. Deanna. <br>
MAQUES: Pleased to. Hello. <br>
TROI: Hello. Pleased to meet you. <br>
MAQUES: Oh, yes, that is it. Pleased to meet you, Deanna. <br>
LWAXANA: Good. Well, I'll just let you young people chat. <br>
(Lwaxana takes Hedril and moves off) <br>
TROI: Well, Maques, what do you think of the Enterprise? <br>
MAQUES: It is beautiful. Comfortable, also. <br>
TROI: I'm glad you think so. <br>
MAQUES: There is another word that describes it. But I cannot remember.
<br>
TROI: You've learned a great deal in a very short time. I'm sure it
won't be long before your words do justice to your thoughts. <br>
MAQUES: Your mother told me of your need. <br>
TROI: Need? <br>
MAQUES: A moment. Husband. You need a husband. I need a wife.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LWAXANA: Deanna! Good morning. So what did you
think of Maques? <br>
TROI: Why did you do that, Mother? You embarrassed both of us. <br>
LWAXANA: He's really very sweet. And lonely. Poor man. A widower,
raising a child alone. <br>
TROI: Mother, don't start. <br>
LWAXANA: I just think it's time for you to settle down. If your father
were still alive, I'm sure he'd say the same thing.

happened to you I don't know what I'd do. <br>
TROI: Nothing's going to happen to me. <br>
LWAXANA: You'd better go. <br>
TROI: My first appointment isn't for a few minutes. Why don't we talk
for a while? <br>
LWAXANA: No, I'm fine. I'm just tired from working with the Cairn. It's
making me emotional. <br>

MAQUES: I must to apologise for yesterday. <br>
TROI: You don't have to. <br>
MAQUES: My words, they were confused. <br>
TROI: It wasn't your fault. Please. (they sit) My mother misled you. <br>
MAQUES: Not in everything. She has an image of you in her mind. She
shared it with me. You are even more beautiful. The way my people
communicate, it is direct. Nothing is hidden. <br>
TROI: Yes? <br>
MAQUES: Your mother is the first to learn our telepathy. <br>
TROI: You mean you've never had telepathy with someone who wasn't
Cairn? <br>
MAQUES: No. To communicate with her is very different. <br>
TROI: In what way? <br>
MAQUES: Always there is a part of her that. Um. A part of her that is
dark. <br>
TROI: Dark? <br>
MAQUES: A part of her that can not be seen. Do you understand? <br>
TROI: I'm not sure. Have you ask my mother about this? <br>
MAQUES: She called it. A moment. Privacy. <br>
TROI: Of course. You said among the Cairn, nothing is hidden. We value
honesty, but we don't always share everything we're thinking and
feeling. <br>
MAQUES: This is privacy? <br>
TROI: Yes. <br>
MAQUES: It is normal? <br>
TROI: For us, yes. <br>
MAQUES: If this is your way, I am relieved. <br>
TROI: It is our way. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TROI: I was all set for another round of arguing
when all of a sudden she just fell apart. <br>
RIKER: She's under a lot of stress. She's preparing the Cairn to meet
with the Federation Council. <br>
TROI: It's more than that. I'm been sensing very erratic emotions from
her. Even the clothes she's wearing are unusual. They're so subdued. <br>
RIKER: Maybe you just need to sit and talk with her. <br>
(Riker puts his hand on Troi's) <br>
LWAXANA: Commander! Take your hands off her. <br>
RIKER: Mrs Troi. <br>
LWAXANA: Don't you Mrs Troi me. <br>
TROI: Mother! <br>
LWAXANA: Why don't you leave her alone? If it weren't for you she'd be
married by now. <br>
TROI: That's enough! <br>
LWAXANA: Now I am warning you. Stay away from my daughter! <br>

tell Will how sorry I am. <br>
CRUSHER: You're fine, but your psilosynine levels are a little low. <br>
LWAXANA: Psilo-what? <br>
TROI: It's a neurotransmitter involved in telepathy. <br>
CRUSHER: It's been depleted by your work with the Cairn. You're going
to have to try to avoid telepathic communication for a while. <br>
LWAXANA: I can't. <br>
CRUSHER: Why? <br>
LWAXANA: We only have three days left and the Cairn have so much to
learn. <br>
CRUSHER: Lwaxana, I'm sorry, but you're going to have to take some time
and rest. <br>
TROI: Maybe I can help with the Cairn. <br>
LWAXANA: No, you're only half Betazoid, dear. And you have no
experience with their form of telepathy. <br>
TROI: Then I won't use telepathy. We'll work verbally. <br>
LWAXANA: I suppose we could do that. And if they don't understand
something I'll explain it to them telepathically. <br>
TROI: No, you'll work verbally too. The point is for you to get some
rest, mother. Besides, it'll do them good to have to figure things out
with words. <br>
LWAXANA: I suppose you're right.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(two children are rolling a ball by a small pool) <br>
TROI: This is the ship's arboretum. <br>
HEDRIL: Arbor means tree. <br>
TROI: Very good, Hedril. This is where people come to relax, enjoy
themselves in a natural setting. <br>
(Maques pricks his finger on a rose thorn) <br>
TROI: Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose. It's an old earth
poem by John Milton. <br>
MAQUES: Please, what is a poem? <br>
TROI: Poetry is an art form that uses words, put together in new and
unexpected ways, sometimes in rhyme. Milton was speculating that in
Heaven, roses wouldn't have thorns. <br>
HEDRIL: Heaven? <br>
TROI: Oh. Er, Heaven is. Well, it's, how can I put it? <br>
(Maques looks at Lwaxana) <br>
MAQUES: Yes, I see. Thank you. Heaven. <br>
TROI: Mother, you're supposed to be avoiding telepathy. <br>
LWAXANA: I'm only trying to help, dear. <br>
TROI: You don't look well. <br>
LWAXANA: I'm just tired. Maybe I'll sit down. <br>
(Hedril goes to play with the other children) <br>
TROI: Don't worry she'll be fine. This is something I think you'll find
interesting. It's a jewel plant from Folnar Three. The plant secretes a
resin which is collected within the blossom. By the time the bloom has
faded, the resin has hardened into a rare and beautiful gem. <br>
(Hedril is walking on the stones around the pond. She falls into the
water, and stands up giggling. It's about 6 inches deep.) <br>
TROI: Mother! <br>

TROI: Mother? Troi to Sickbay. Medical emergency in the arboretum. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: She's not responding to cortical
stimulation. I'm not sure what else I can do. <br>
TROI: I don't understand. She was fine just yesterday. <br>
CRUSHER: It's so strange. It's almost as if her brain has shut itself
down. <br>
PICARD: Is there a physiological cause? <br>
CRUSHER: I'm running a subneural scan. As far as I can see there's no
tissue damage, no neurochemical imbalance, no sign of infection,
nothing. <br>
PICARD: Yet her neural activity is practically non-existent. <br>
CRUSHER: The only exception is in the paracortex. Activity there is
almost off the scale. <br>
TROI: The paracortex is the Betazoid telepathic lobe. She communicated
with Maques telepathically just before she fell. <br>
PICARD: Might there be some side effect of Cairn telepathy of which
we're unaware? <br>
CRUSHER: It's a possibility. <br>
PICARD: I think it's time that you and I had a talk with Maques.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Maques' quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MAQUES: I am very apologetic for what has happened
to your mother. <br>
PICARD: Maques, is it possible that your telepathic communications with
Mrs Troi harmed her in some way? <br>
MAQUES: No. I tried to explain before. Bad thoughts, they hurt her. <br>
TROI: What thoughts? Take your time. <br>
MAQUES: Inside her, the dark place. <br>
TROI: I don't understand. <br>
MAQUES: She is, what are the words? I don't have the words. <br>
(So he sends Troi the pictures instead, and Troi puts her hands over
her ears) <br>
PICARD: Counsellor? Stop it! <br>
TROI: It's all right. I'm fine. He was just trying to communicate with
me telepathically. <br>
MAQUES: Do you understand now? <br>
TROI: I'm not sure. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Crusher's office]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TROI: He communicated so much to me that at first
it was just a jumble of images. <br>
CRUSHER: Have you been able to sort any of it out? <br>
TROI: I think so. During his telepathic contact with my mother, Maques
sensed what he calls a dark place. He tried to tell me about it before,
in my office, and I misunderstood. I thought he was talking about
thoughts my mother was keeping private, but what he meant was that
there was something happening in her met conscious mind. <br>
CRUSHER: Metaconscious? <br>
TROI: It's a part of the Betazoid psyche. It's a kind of filtering
mechanism that protects us from psychic trauma. <br>
PICARD: Is Maques suggesting that your mother's metaconscious has been
somehow damaged? <br>
TROI: He feels that whatever is wrong with her is centred there. If
he's right it may mean that she's suffered some kind of trauma that her
metaconscious just can't tolerate. <br>
CRUSHER: Has your mother mentioned anything that happened to her
lately, something that might have been traumatic for her? <br>
TROI: No. Nothing. <br>
CRUSHER: Maques could be wrong about this. There's still a chance that
a subneural scan might be able to pinpoint an physiological cause for
your mother's condition, something that I might be able to treat. The
results won't be in until morning. Maybe we should all try and get some
rest. <br>
TROI: I'd like to stay here with her. I'm going to try to contact her
telepathically. <br>
CRUSHER: All right.

TROI: Yes? <br>
MAQUES: You must. How can I explain <br>
TROI: Tell me telepathically. <br>
(the direct stare) <br>
TROI: Maques believes my mother's psyche has collapsed in on itself.
That for some reason, she has retreated into her metaconscious mind. <br>
PICARD: Was he trying to contact her telepathically? <br>
TROI: Yes. He was able to access images being generated by her
metaconscious, but he couldn't make any sense of them. <br>
MAQUES: I did not understand. <br>
TROI: He saw faces he didn't recognize, events he couldn't interpret. <br>
CRUSHER: If we could decipher these images, we might be able to
determine whether or not your mother's condition was induced by a
traumatic event. <br>
TROI: Maques feels he can provide a telepathic bridge that will allow
me to access my mother's metaconscious. If he can, I might be able to
find out what happened to her. <br>
PICARD: And if you succeed, can you use that information to help your
mother? <br>
TROI: I'm not sure. But I do know that there's a part of her that wants
to be helped. When I tried to contact her telepathically, I heard a
voice calling out to me. <br>

mind pose any danger to you? <br>

study of dream analysis that people who appear in a dream can sometimes
represent different aspects of the person who is dreaming. <br>

depict some fragile part of my mother. <br>

weaker. Have you had any luck here? <br>
TROI: No, nothing. I've gone through all her belongings, read her
journal from the last five years, and other than the fact that I'm not
married yet, nothing bad seems to have happened to her. <br>
PICARD: Is this your Father? <br>
TROI: Yes. <br>
PICARD: He had a kind face. <br>
TROI: I remember when he died, my mother had to go through all his
things and pack them away. I was seven. I remember thinking how mad
he'd be when he came home and saw what she'd done. I didn't understand
he wasn't coming back. <br>
PICARD: Deanna, your mother might still come out of this. <br>
TROI: If we can't figure out what's wrong with her, Captain, I don't
think she will. But I don't know what else to do. I've talked with
Mister Homn, who's known her for years. I've checked her medical
records. I've made enquiries to the government on Betazed, I've
contacted her closest friends. If she's been through some kind of
psychic trauma, there's just no evidence of it. <br>
PICARD: You said you'd reviewed her journals for the past five years.
Maybe we should go further back. <br>
TROI: That's a lot to review. My mother's kept a journal since before
she was married. <br>
PICARD: Then let's start at the beginning. The first entry seems to be
stardate 30620.1. <br>
TROI: That's the year they were married. <br>
PICARD: That's odd. There's a seven year gap. <br>
TROI: It starts about a year after the wedding. <br>
PICARD: And if I'm not mistaken, it ends a few months after your birth.
<br>
TROI: My mother's so diligent about her journal. why would she have
stopped making entries for so long? <br>
PICARD: She didn't. The files were deleted, by your mother, almost
thirty years ago. <br>
TROI: I don't understand any of this. Captain, I have to go back inside
my mother's mind. It's the only way we're ever going to get any
answers.

TROI: Mother? <br>
LWAXANA: Go away. <br>
TROI: No. I want to help you. Why did you delete parts of your journal?
Did something happen to you you don't want me to know about? <br>
LWAXANA: Leave me alone, please. <br>
TROI: Who's Hedril, mother? Why is she here? Is Hedril me when I was a
little girl? <br>
LWAXANA: No! Oh, no, I'd never let anything happen to you. Never. <br>
TROI: Did you let something happen to someone? Was it here at El'nar? <br>
LWAXANA: You were just a baby. <br>

is sitting nearby) <br>

IAN: Hold on to him. Don't let him run off. <br>
HEDRIL: I won't. Mommy, can we go play by the water? <br>
LWAXANA: No, Kestra, stay here with us. <br>
HEDRIL: Please? <br>

LWAXANA: Kestra. Oh, Kestra, you've made the baby cry. <br>
TROI: Kestra? <br>
LWAXANA: Don't cry, Deanna. Don't cry, mommy's here. <br>
HEDRIL: Mommy, please? <br>
IAN: No, Kestra. We're going to eat in just a few minutes. <br>
LWAXANA: What's wrong, what's wrong, little one? Tell mommy what's
wrong. Ian, she's teething, Now where's her ring? <br>
(it goes dark) <br>
LWAXANA: No, no. I don't want to see this again. I can't. <br>
TROI: What happened, Mother. What happened next? <br>
LWAXANA: I don't remember. <br>
TROI: You have to. You can't hold it back. It's killing you. <br>
LWAXANA: The dog got away. She ran after him. We didn't notice. <br>
(lights up, Ian is soaking wet and Lwaxana is distraught) <br>
(back to the dark) <br>
LWAXANA: Why? Why did I look away? Why wasn't I paying attention? <br>
TROI: You have to forgive yourself, Mother. You have to let go. <br>
LWAXANA: How can I? I let her die. <br>
TROI: It was a terrible tragedy. The worst thing that can happen to any
parent. I know you feel responsible but it was an accident. And what
you're doing isn't fair to Kestra. <br>
TROI: I saw a little girl who was sweet and happy. She must have
brought a great deal of joy to your lives. <br>
LWAXANA: She woke up every morning with a smile. <br>
TROI: Isn't it better to remember her like that? I just found out I had
a sister I never knew. I'd like to learn what was good and joyous about
her. To celebrate her life, not mourn it. <br>
LWAXANA: How? How can I do that? <br>
TROI: Kestra was here a few moments ago. Talk to her. <br>
LWAXANA: No. No. <br>
TROI: Do it, mother. Tell her how you feel. I'll be here with you. I'll
help you. <br>
KESTRA: Mommy. <br>
LWAXANA: Kestra. Oh, Kestra. My precious one. I'm so sorry. <br>
