LAFORGE: We don't ordinarily say please to food dispensers around here.<br>
SONYA: Well, since it's listed as intelligent circuitry, why not? After
all, working with so much artificial intelligence can be dehumanising,
right? So why not combat that tendency with a little simple courtesy.
Thank you.<br>
LAFORGE: For someone who just arrived, you certainly aren't shy with
your opinions.<br>
SONYA: Have I been talking too much?<br>
LAFORGE: No.<br>
SONYA: Oh, I do tend to have a bit of a motor mouth, especially when
I'm excited. A nd you don't know how exciting it is to get this
assignment. Everyone in class, I mean everyone, wants the Enterprise. I
mean, it would have been all right to spend some time on Reiner Six
doing phase work with anti-matter. That's my specialty.<br>
LAFORGE: I know. That's why you got this assignment.<br>
SONYA: I did it again. It's just that <br>
LAFORGE: I know, you're excited. Look, Sonya.<br>
SONYA: Yes.<br>
LAFORGE: I don't think you want to be around these control stations
with that hot chocolate, do you?<br>
SONYA: Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't even have this in Engineering. It's
just we were talking and I forgot I had it in my hand. I'm going to go
finish it over here. Lieutenant La Forge? This is not going to happen
again.<br>
(So she turns around and her drink collides with Captain Picard, going
all over his uniform) <br>
SONYA: Oh, no! Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, Captain. <br>
LAFORGE: Actually it's my fault, sir. <br>
PICARD: Indeed. <br>
SONYA: Oh, I wasn't looking. It's all over you.<br>
PICARD: Yes, Ensign. It's all over me.<br>
SONYA: At least let me, sir. <br>
PICARD: Ensign er, Ensign? <br>
SONYA: Oh, Ensign Sonya Gomez.<br>
LAFORGE: Ensign Gomez is a recent Academy graduate. She just
transferred over at Starbase One Seventy Three.<br>
PICARD: Is that so? Well, Ensign Sonya Gomez, I think it will be
simpler if I simply change my uniform. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain, I must accept responsibility for this. <br>
PICARD: Yes, Chief Engineer. I think I understand.<br>
SONYA: I just want to say, sir, that I'm very excited about this
assignment and I promise to serve you and my ship, your ship, this
ship, to the best of my ability.<br>
PICARD: Yes, Ensign, I'm sure that you will. Carry on.<br>
(Picard leaves) <br>
SONYA: Oh, my. First impressions, right? Isn't that what they say?
First impressions are the most important.<br>
LAFORGE: I'll give you this. It's a meeting the Captain won't soon
forget.

Q: You! Picard, if you had half the sense you pretend to have, you
would get her off your ship immediately. And if you like, I'd be more
than pleased to expedite her departure.<br>
PICARD: You know him? <br>
GUINAN: We have had some dealings.<br>
Q: Those dealings were two centuries ago. This creature is not what she
appears to be. She's an imp, and where she goes, trouble always follows.<br>
PICARD: You're speaking of yourself, Q, not Guinan.<br>
Q: Guinan? Is that your name now?<br>

you would stop meddling with us.<br>
Q: And so I have.<br>

Q: Ah, the redoubtable Commander Riker. And Micro-brain. Growl for me.
Let me know you still care. <br>
PICARD: Worf. <br>
Q: My purpose is to join you.<br>
RIKER: To join us as what?<br>
Q: As a member of the crew. Willing and able. Ready to serve. This ship
is already home for the indigent, the unwanted, the unworthy. Why not
for a homeless entity.<br>
RIKER: Homeless?<br>
Q: Yes.<br>
RIKER: The other members of the Q continuum kicked you out.<br>
GUINAN: Not all the Q are alike. Some are almost respectable.<br>
PICARD: Ready and willing. Able to serve. What would you do? Would you
start as an ordinary crewman? What task is too menial for an entity?<br>
Q: Sir, do you mock me?<br>
PICARD: Not at all. That's the last thing I would do. You, by
definition, are part of our charter. Our mission is to go forth to seek
out new and different life forms, and you certainly qualify as one of
the most unique I've ever encountered. To learn about you is, frankly,
provocative. But you're next of kin to chaos.<br>
Q: Captain, at least allow me to present my argument. <br>
PICARD: Worf. <br>
(Worf goes to stand guard outside) <br>
Q: After our last encounter, I was asked to leave the Q Continuum.
Since then, I've been wandering vaguely, bored really, my existence
without purpose. Then I remembered all the good times I had with you. <br>
RIKER: The good times? The first time we met you, you put us on trial
for the crimes of humanity. <br>
Q: Of which you were exonerated.<br>
RIKER: The next time we saw you, you asked me to join the Q Continuum.<br>
Q: A big mistake that you did not accept my offer. More and more I
realise that here, here is where I want to be. Think of the advantages.
Now, I neither expect nor require any special treatment. And if
necessary, although I can't imagine why, I will renounce my powers and
become as weak and incompetent as all of you.<br>
PICARD: No.<br>
Q: No? Oh, Captain, in fairness, let me try, I deserve at least that
much.<br>
RIKER: In fairness? You disrupt this ship, you kidnap the Captain. <br>
Q: I add a little excitement, a little spice to your lives, and all you
do is complain. Where's your adventurous spirit, your imagination.
Think, Picard, think. Think of the possibilities.<br>
PICARD: Simply speaking, we don't trust you.<br>
Q: Oh. Well, you may not trust me, but you do need me. You're not
prepared for what awaits you.<br>
PICARD: How can we be prepared for that which we do not know? But I do
know that we are ready to encounter it.<br>
Q: Really?<br>
PICARD: yes. Absolutely. That's why we're out here.<br>
Q: Oh, the arrogance. They don't have a clue as to what's out here.<br>
GUINAN: But they will learn, adapt. That is their greatest advantage.<br>
Q: They're moving faster than expected, further than they should.<br>
PICARD: By whose calculations? <br>
Q: You judge yourselves against the pitiful adversaries you have
encountered so far. The Romulans, the Klingons. They are nothing
compared to what's waiting. Picard, you are about to move into areas of
the galaxy containing wonders more incredible than you can possibly
imagine, and terrors to freeze your soul. I offer myself as guide only
to be rejected out of hand. <br>
RIKER: We'll just have to do the best we can without you.<br>
Q: What justifies that smugness?<br>
PICARD: Not smugness, not arrogance. But we are resolute, we are
determined, and your help is not required.<br>
Q: We'll just have to see how ready you are.<br>
GUINAN: Q! <br>

than usual) <br>

PICARD: Again, Mister Worf. <br>
(Two more holes are blown in the scaffolding) <br>

hull integrity. <br>
RIKER: Damage report? <br>
WORF: Coming in, sir. Sections twenty seven, twenty eight, twenty nine
on decks four, five and six destroyed.<br>
PICARD: Casualties? <br>
WORF: Eighteen were in those sections and are missing.<br>
PICARD: What is the condition of the alien ship?<br>
WORF: They have sustained damage to twenty percent of their vessel.
Life support minimal.<br>

these creatures? <br>
GUINAN: Bits and pieces. <br>
PICARD: Anything would help. <br>
GUINAN: They're made up of organic and artificial life which has been
developing for thousands of centuries. <br>
Q: The Borg is the ultimate user. They're unlike any threat your
Federation has ever faced. They're not interested in political
conquest, wealth or power as you know it. They're simply interested in
your ship, its technology. They've identified it as something they can
consume.<br>
RIKER: You brought us here, you exposed us to them, and you cost us the
lives of our shipmates <br>
Q: Oh, please. <br>
PICARD: Number One. Eighteen of our people have died. Please, tell us
this is one of your illusions.<br>
Q: Oh, no. This is as real as your so called life gets.<br>
(And he vanishes) <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: This is Lieutenant La Forge, Captain. We've been able to
restore power to the shields.<br>
PICARD: Very good.&nbsp;<br>
WORF [OC]: Captain, I have the casualty list coming on screen.<br>
PICARD: Cancel. We'll deal with that later.<br>
RIKER: Sir, if we're going to have further dealings with the Borg now
or in the future, I think that we should find out all we can about them.<br>
PICARD: Visit their ship?<br>
RIKER: In my opinion, that's the only choice.<br>
PICARD: Assemble a minimal away team.<br>
GUINAN: What?<br>
RIKER: Mister Worf, transporter room three. Data.<br>
GUINAN: I wouldn't go there if I were you.<br>
RIKER: Oh, I don't know, Guinan. They paid us a visit. It seems only
fair that we return the courtesy.

it. Energise.

everywhere) <br>
RIKER: I wonder why they don't react to us, or why the Enterprise
didn't read any life signs, especially with this many of them.<br>
DATA: Perhaps because this ship was scanned for individual life signs.
Apparently when they are in these slots, they become part of the whole
and no longer read as separate life forms.<br>

PICARD [OC]: Explain.<br>
RIKER: There are slots along the wall, kind of like compartments. There
are two Borg in each.<br>
DATA: Captain, I would theorise that the Borg are somehow
interconnected through these slots and are working collectively.<br>
RIKER: We're going try to access their main computer.<br>
(Data steps into a slot - or alcove) <br>
DATA: Commander, I believe each slot is designed for a specific Borg.
Here is where the connection is made.<br>
RIKER: Like a juggernaut, it could begin moving at any moment.<br>
DATA: The technology required to achieve this biological and artificial
interface is far beyond our capabilities. There are many advantages.<br>
RIKER: Speed being the most obvious. This ship literally just thinks
what it wants, and then it happens.<br>
(A Borg walks past them, taking no notice) <br>

RIKER: From the look of it the Borg are born as biological life form.

wanted to frighten us. We're frightened. You wanted to show us that we
were inadequate. For the moment, I grant that. You wanted me to say I

could have been learned without the loss of eighteen members of my crew.<br>

home and crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous,
with treasures to satiate desires both subtle and gross, but it's not

ready, it might be possible to establish a relationship with them. But
for now, for right now, you're just raw material to them. Since they
are aware of your existence <br>
