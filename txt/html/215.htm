Captain's log, stardate 45571.2. We are going into orbit around an
unexplored M-class moon of Mab-Bu Six. Though the moon was reported to
be uninhabited, we have picked up a weak distress call.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: The intense electromagnetic whirlwinds on the
moon's surface make it virtually impossible to locate the source of the
signal, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Any indications of life, Mister Worf? <br>
WORF: Scanners read negative, sir, but they may be affected by the
interference. <br>
RIKER: Have you ever heard anything like this, Data? <br>
DATA: I believe so, Commander. At Starfleet Academy. <br>
PICARD: The Academy? <br>
DATA: I will verify it. Just as I thought. It is a Starfleet subspace
distress signal, standard to Daedalus-class starships. <br>
RIKER: There hasn't been a Daedalus class in service for what? <br>
DATA: One hundred seventy two years, sir. <br>
PICARD: Are there any records of missing ships in this vicinity? <br>
DATA: The USS Essex under the command of Captain Bryce Shumar
disappeared in this sector over two centuries ago. <br>
PICARD: Daedalus class. <br>
DATA: I have accessed the subspace transponder signature of the Essex.
It is identical to the signal coming from the moon's surface. <br>
RIKER: W arrived a little late. <br>
PICARD: Mute it, Mister Data. With that storm activity down there, it
isn't worth the risk to check on a ghost ship. Advise Starfleet that we
have solved the mystery of Captain Shumar and the Essex. <br>
TROI: I'm not sure we have. Someone's down there. Alive.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First officer's log, supplemental. The
electromagnetic interference on the surface has been judged too
dangerous for anyone to transport down, so we have taken a shuttle to
investigate.

DATA: Shields are holding, sir. <br>
RIKER: Wind shear is incredible. Data, keep an eye on the stabilisers.
If it's anything like this on the ground, I don't see how anyone can
survive on this moon for long. <br>
TROI: Maybe they've been living underground. <br>
RIKER: Question is where? I still can't locate the source of the damn
signal. It's bouncing around more than we are. <br>

PICARD: Do we have their position? <br>
WORF: I am picking up the shuttle's trace signature, but the surface
interference is distorting its position. <br>

calculate the coordinates from the angle of descent. </font></p>

TROI: Your arm. <br>
RIKER: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's broken. Enterprise? <br>
DATA: It is unlikely that we will be able to establish communication
with the ship, given the electromagnetic interference. <br>
RIKER: We'll stay in the area until the Enterprise finds us. Take an
inventory of the shuttle. See if there's anything left in there that's
usable. The ground cover is all non-porous rock, which makes me believe
it's even less likely there's anyone living here. <br>
DATA: There are no instruments left of practical value that have not
been damaged by our landing, sir. <br>
TROI: What is that? <br>
RIKER: That doesn't look like any storm front I've ever seen. <br>
DATA: The tricorder is picking up high levels of EM bursts across the
spectrum. No lifesign readings other than our own. <br>
TROI: There is someone alive here. I'm more certain of it now than
ever. <br>
RIKER: Well, I hope they can find us, because there's no way we'll find
them. <br>

O'BRIEN: Nice spot for a picnic, sir. We need to distribute these
enhancer rods at seven metre lengths. That should do it. <br>
RIKER: Is this storm front going to interfere with the transport,
Chief? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'd really like to get us out of here before it hits,
Commander. I'm supposed to be feeding the baby lunch. Molly gets in a
terribly foul mood if I'm late. <br>

you to take your time, Counsellor. Doctor's orders. <br>

close to it. <br>
PICARD: Bridge. How do you suggest we proceed? <br>
RIKER: We need to adjust the scanners so they can penetrate those

DATA: We might be able to employ virtual imaging to interpolate
(metallic sound) missing data. <br>
PICARD: Is something wrong, Commander?

us to a synchronous orbit aligned around our crash site. <br>
(Picard and Troi leave) <br>
RO: Aye, sir. <br>
DATA: Sir, given the EM field properties of this moon, I recommend a
search pattern beginning in the southern polar region. <br>
RIKER: The polar region? That would be starting from scratch, Mister
Data. Our latest
readings would suggest that we begin our scan around our crash site. <br>
DATA: The Essex signal was never clearly located, sir. A systematic
survey of the moon from a polar orbit might be more practical. <br>
RIKER: Well, you might be right, but I'd like to give the crash site a
once over first. Maintain our current orbit. <br>

though they were calling to me. <br>

carried on the wind. <br>
PICARD: What were they trying to communicate? <br>

or neutralise this anionic energy once it's out of our people. <br>

requested, I would like to know the nature of the injuries to the

Steven Mullen (Data), and my Security Chief, Lieutenant Morgan Kelly.

PICARD: How did this happen to you? <br>
TROI: I can't explain how it happened. I only know that it did. The
Essex was caught in an electromagnetic storm just as your shuttle was.
Moments before we crashed, the bridge was struck by lightning. The ship
was ripped apart. Somehow, in that instant, our consciousness was
absorbed in the magnetic currents on the surface. <br>
PICARD: Why didn't you tell us this? Why the deception? The violence? <br>

TROI: Then you know I am correct. <br>
PICARD: End this, and I will give you whatever help you need. <br>

manipulating you. <br>
TROI: Captain Picard has every right to be curious. <br>
DATA: He will try to delay until a rescue attempt is possible. <br>
TROI: I know that. I also know that he will make every effort to
protect the lives of his people. Since our demands are not excessive,
Captain, I hope you will see that it will be simpler to accede than to
risk further injuries. <br>

TROI: It was as though my own consciousness were pushed to the side. I
was watching
everything happen, hearing my own voice, but not being able to control
any of it. <br>
PICARD: What about the entity that controlled you, What were your
perceptions of him? <br>
TROI: He was intelligent, actually. Thoughtful, in a ruthless sort of
way. Cold. <br>
DATA: Lieutenant, I must apologise for my inadvertent misconduct toward
you. <br>
WORF: No apology necessary. <br>
DATA: Your restraint was most remarkable. <br>
WORF: You have no idea. </font></p>
