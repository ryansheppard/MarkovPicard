Captain's log, stardate 41723.9. In response to a Starfleet order we
are in the Xendi Sabu star system, having rendezvoused with a Ferengi
vessel which has requested a meeting. Although we arrived here and made
appropriate signals to the Ferengi three days ago, they have so far
responded only with the message, stand by Enterprise.

CRUSHER: You sent for me, sir? <br>
PICARD: Yes, Doctor. Sit down. Look, this perhaps may be nothings, but
I've been feeling a bit odd of late. Fatigued. And now I've got this
damned headache. <br>
CRUSHER: A what? <br>
PICARD: Headache. Headache. Surely you know what a headache is. <br>
CRUSHER: Of course. But I don't often encounter them. <br>
PICARD: The reason is obvious, of course. What are the Ferengi up to?
Stand by, Enterprise. Stand by for what? <br>
CRUSHER: I don't see a thing wrong. <br>
PICARD: No, neither can I. Unless they're baiting some kind of trap. <br>
CRUSHER: With your head. I see nothing physically wrong, but I want to
run some additional scans in Sickbay. <br>
PICARD: Doctor, all I've got is <br>
CRUSHER: Is an order to report to Sickbay. From the one person aboard
this ship who can give you an order. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Captain from First Officer. They're finally sending a
message. <br>
PICARD: On my way, Number One. Sorry, Doctor. Duty calls.

PICARD: Have they given any hint of what they've been waiting for? <br>
TASHA: Negative, Captain. They've identified their Captain as Bok.
DaiMon Bok. <br>
LAFORGE: You'll be able to see him now, sir. They're willing to
communicate on visual. <br>
PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. <br>
TASHA: Hailing frequencies open, sir. <br>
PICARD: Ferengi vessel. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
Enterprise. We are transmitting visually. <br>
BOK [on viewscreen]: Is this the Captain Picard? <br>
PICARD: Do we know each other? <br>
BOK [on viewscreen]: I know you, Picard. <br>
PICARD: Then you have the advantage. Is this Bok? <br>
BOK [on viewscreen]: I am Bok, DaiMon of the Ferengi. I have asked you
here to discuss a mutual problem, Captain. <br>
PICARD: What problem is that, DaiMon Bok? <br>
BOK [on viewscreen]: I insist on speaking of that matter in person.
Shall we meet on your vessel or mine? <br>
(Troi signals the transmission cut) <br>
TASHA: Hailing frequencies closed. <br>
TROI: Captain, I sense considerable deception on Bok's part. And
danger. <br>
RIKER: Then we should meet him here. Keep him under our control. <br>
(Picard nods) <br>
TASHA: Now open, sir. <br>
PICARD: I appreciate your offer, DaiMon Bok. We would like you to be
our guest here. <br>
BOK [on viewscreen]: As you wish, Picard. Perhaps this will begin a new
era of cooperation for both our peoples. In one Earth hour, then? <br>
PICARD: In one hour, DaiMon Bok. End transmission. <br>
WORF: I can't believe they're coming here. <br>

why.

PICARD: Are you always accustomed to getting your way, Doctor? <br>
CRUSHER: Only when my way makes sense, Captain. There are still forty
minutes before the Ferengi beam over. I'll have these scans done in
ten. <br>
PICARD: It seems an awful lot of effort for something as simple as a
headache. <br>
CRUSHER: As simple? You should not have a headache unless there's
something wrong, sir. It may be true that headaches were once quite
common, but that was in the days before the brain was charted, before
we understood the nature of pain. When we were suffering from such
things as the common cold. <br>
PICARD: So what's the cause of my headache? <br>
CRUSHER: I haven't the slightest idea. (she puts something against his
temple) Feel better. <br>
PICARD: The pain's gone. <br>
CRUSHER: Medical fakery. The pain is actually still there. It's just
cloaked. I'll want further exams. <br>

WESLEY: If you'll scan heading four four mark one six three,
Lieutenant, you'll find <br>
TASHA: Intruder alert, sir. <br>
LAFORGE: I've got something, sir. <br>
WESLEY: It's an old style starship, Constellation Class, heading this
way under impulse power, sir. <br>
(Picard enters) <br>
RIKER: Says who? <br>
PICARD: Ensign, answer the First Officer's question. <br>
WESLEY: Says the long distance sensors, sir. I was in Engineering,
playing around with boosting sensor output. <br>
DATA: Boosting it? How? (catches Picard's eye) We will discuss this
later. <br>
LAFORGE: I read it now, sir, as a Constellation class starship heading
this way under impulse power. Sending no call letters, sir. <br>
PICARD: The correct procedure, <br>
RIKER: What's wrong, sir? <br>
PICARD: Oh, it's nothing. It's just a, just a mild headache. The
correct procedure, Ensign, would have been to signal the Bridge of your
finding immediately. <br>
WESLEY: Yes, sir. <br>
RIKER: Bringing it here personally, perhaps with the idea of being on
hand for the Ferengi beam over, might have imperiled this vessel had it
been something hostile approaching. <br>
WESLEY: Yes, sir. <br>
WORF: We are receiving no signal at all from the approaching starship,
sir. <br>
DATA: Time, sir. <br>
PICARD: Time? Oh, for the Ferengi to beam over. Do you see any problems
connected with this old starship coming in, Number One? <br>
RIKER: Suggest it would be safer, sir, to have the Ferengi here

BOK: It is our pleasure, Captain Picard. Might I introduce my First
Officer, Kazago, and my Second, Rata? <br>
PICARD: This is my First Officer, Commander William Riker. Second in
command, Data. Counsellor Troi. <br>
BOK: We have heard that you use females. Clothed females. Most
interesting. <br>
RIKER: They are that, sir. <br>
KAZAGO: And the android was mentioned too. What is its price? We should
like to purchase it. <br>
PICARD: He is not for sale. Commander Data is, um, is, um <br>
RIKER: Is second-hand merchandise. You wouldn't want him. <br>
DATA: Second-hand, sir? Oh, of course. A human joke. <br>
TASHA: Excuse, Captain, but the unidentified starship is coming in.
Still no signal at all. <br>
BOK: Think nothing of it. It is under our control. <br>
PICARD: One of our starships under your control? <br>
BOK: Do not be alarmed, Captain. It is a gift from us. With which we
honour the Hero of Maxia. <br>
PICARD: Who? <br>
BOK: Why you, Picard, of course. Do you not remember the Battle of
Maxia? <br>
PICARD: I'm sorry, I do not remember it, DaiMon Bok. Data? <br>
DATA: Captain, he may refer to an incident which occurred nine years
ago in the Maxia Zeta star system, in which an unidentified starship <br>
BOK: Unidentified? That fine vessel was Ferengi. <br>
DATA: Which you destroyed, sir. <br>
PICARD: The Battle of Maxia. I've never heard it referred to so
dramatically before. My sincere regrets, Bok, but that vessel refused
to identify itself. It simply attacked us. We defended ourselves. <br>
BOK: Such mistakes happen in space. <br>
DATA: Hardly a mistake, sir. Your report shows that it deliberately
attacked. <br>
TASHA: Do you want the arriving vessel on main viewer, sir? It is only
a thousand kilometres away now. <br>
BOK: Put it on your viewer. <br>
PICARD: Main viewer. <br>
BOK: There is no one aboard it. <br>
RATA: The log should be downloaded into the Enterprise's records. At a
price. <br>
BOK: No price! <br>
KAZAGO: No price? <br>
PICARD: For what purpose? What (clutches his head in pain) <br>
TROI: I just felt something too, Captain. <br>
BOK: Perhaps it is his conscience? <br>
RIKER: Bridge to Sickbay. <br>
PICARD: No, no. I'm fine <br>
TROI: It felt as if it were something from your past. <br>
PICARD: It's right. I'm fine. What is this all about? <br>
BOK: It is about the battle I mentioned, Captain. A gift, in honour of
that occasion. Look at that ship closely. <br>
PICARD: Magnify please, Lieutenant La Forge. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Why, it's the Stargazer. It's my old ship. How did you find it?
<br>
BOK: It was a derelict, adrift in space on the far side of this star
system. How it got there is none of my business, Captain. But now, that
vessel is yours, if you wish to have it. <br>
KAZAGO: We are not selling it to him? <br>
BOK: Consider it an act of friendship. <br>
RATA: At no cost? Oh, ugly. Very ugly.

CRUSHER: You said you felt something yourself. <br>
TROI: I believe so. Like a thought, but rather mechanical in nature. <br>
PICARD: Are you sure it wasn't one of my thoughts? At that moment, I
was remembering being at the helm of the Stargazer. A manoeuvre was
being made. We were hit. Something's burning. I can smell smoke. Can
you smell it? <br>
CRUSHER: There's nothing burning, Jean-Luc. <br>
PICARD: That was just part of my memory. <br>
TROI: Memory or nightmare? <br>

PICARD: We were traveling at warp two through the Maxia Zeta star
system when this unidentified starship suddenly appeared and fired on
us, point-blank range. <br>
RIKER: Where did it come from? <br>
PICARD: It must have been lying in some deep moon crater. First attack
damaged the shields. In the confusion, they hit us a second time. <br>
TASHA: No clue who they were? <br>
PICARD: No names, no reason. Can you identify them, Vigo? If they come
in a second time with our shields damaged <br>
TROI: Sir? Who's Vigo? <br>
PICARD: He's my weapons officer on the Stargazer. I'm getting quite
caught up in this. <br>
RIKER: Your shields were failing, sir. <br>
PICARD: I improvised. With the enemy vessel coming in for the kill, I
ordered a sensor bearing, and when it went into the return arc <br>
DATA: You performed what Starfleet textbooks now refer to as the Picard
Manoeuvre.&nbsp;<br>
PICARD: Well, I did what any good helmsman would have done. I dropped
into high warp, stopped right off the enemy vessel's bow and fired with
everything I had. <br>
RIKER: And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant
to be in two places at once. <br>
PICARD: And our attacker fired on the wrong one. <br>
RIKER: I did what any good helmsman could have done. You did it first,
sir. <br>
PICARD: It was a save our skins manoeuvre. We were finished. On fire.
We had to abandon ship. We limped through space in shuttlecraft for
weeks before we were picked up. I haven't thought about this for years.
<br>
DATA: Sir, the Ferengi are standing by for us to take possession of the
Stargazer. <br>

safe. <br>

produce an aggregate amount which <br>
RIKER: I don't want a computer science lesson, Data. Bottom line. <br>

LAFORGE: Captain. You're looking better, sir. <br>
PICARD: A little sleep, thanks to the good Doctor, works wonders. What
report on the logs? <br>

did you sleep through the Academy lecture on conservation of tractor
beam power? <br>

his. <br>

WESLEY: I know, Mom, but this is important. When I went back to the
main sensors in Engineering to try some more sensitivity experiments <br>
TROI: Does this have something to do with Captain Picard? <br>
WESLEY: Yes, ma'am, if this is what you're talking about here. I don't
know much about brain scans but I glanced at these when you were
studying them, and I noticed that these patterns are the same as those
picked up from the low-intensity transmissions from the Ferengi ship. I
went back and checked, and they're exactly the same. <br>
TROI: What kind of transmissions? <br>
WESLEY: I don't know. Engineering has nothing like it on record. <br>
TROI: Let's get to the Captain. <br>

RIKER: Did who say? <br>
CRUSHER: My son. Transmissions which exactly match certain anomalies
found in the Captain's brain scans. Something over there is affecting
the Captain's thought patterns. <br>
