Captain's log, stardate 41798.2. We have been ordered by Starfleet to
proceed to the Lorenze Cluster and investigate the disappearance of a
light cruiser, USS Drake, which was in that system trying to unravel a
mystery of its own which began when recent long range probes indicated
that all intelligent life on the planet Minos has disappeared.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Number One? <br>
RIKER: No help from their communications log. The Drake reported
arriving at Minos and then wasn't heard from again. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data? <br>
DATA: The citizens of Minos gained fame during the Ersalrope wars as
arms merchants. They manufactured sophisticated and highly advanced
weaponry. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah? For which side? <br>
DATA: Both. <br>
LAFORGE: We are approaching the planet Minos, sir. <br>
PICARD: Standard orbit, Mister La Forge. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. Standard orbit. <br>
RIKER: Whatever happened to the Drake, happened quickly, otherwise a
man like Rice would have reported again. <br>
PICARD: You know Captain Rice? <br>
RIKER: We were at the Academy together. <br>
PICARD: Tell me about him. <br>
RIKER: Able. A good officer. <br>
TROI: How would he react under stress? <br>
RIKER: Paul Rice is confident to the point of arrogance, he but carries
it well because he's usually right. He's a risk taker. <br>
PICARD: Really? <br>
RIKER: I'll give you an example. One of the final tests in advance
navigation at the Academy provides the student with three options. Rice
was given this test, rejected their options and offered one of his own.
<br>
PICARD: That's taking a risk. <br>
RIKER: And it paid off. He received the top grade and now that same
test has four options. <br>
TROI: In a difficult situation a man like that would act aggressively. <br>
RIKER: Agreed. <br>
WORF: Commander, weren't you offered the Drake? <br>
RIKER: Yes. <br>
TASHA: You gave up your own command to take this assignment? <br>
RIKER: At the time I thought it would be more advantageous for me to do
a tour on the Enterprise. <br>
DATA: Captain, readings correspond with the findings of the probe. No
signs of intelligent life forms. Vegetation and animal life only. <br>
TROI: What happened to all the people? <br>
WORF: War? <br>
DATA: Disease? <br>
LAFORGE: A dissatisfied customer? <br>
TASHA: In any war, natural disaster, even the most virulent plague,
there are always survivors. <br>
DATA: Captain, we are being hailed. <br>
RIKER: How can that be from a planet with no people? <br>
PICARD: Your sensors indicated no intelligent life forms? <br>
DATA: Correct, sir. Something has scanned our language banks and is
hailing us. <br>
PICARD: On main viewer. <br>
SALESMAN [on viewscreen]: Whoever you are, wherever you're from,
greetings. Welcome to Minos, the arsenal of freedom. <br>
PICARD: I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS <br>
SALESMAN [on viewscreen]: If you need a little something special, be it
for one target or multiple targets, we got it. You'll see it here on
Minos, where we live by the motto 'peace through superior firepower'. <br>
PICARD: To whom am I speaking? <br>
SALESMAN [on viewscreen]: To be totally armed is to be totally secure.
Remember, the early bird that hesitates gets wormed. <br>
DATA: It is a recorded message, sir. <br>
SALESMAN [on viewscreen]: Minos, the arsenal of freedom. Perfection in
highly advanced weaponry. Versatility. <br>
PICARD: We must have triggered something left over from the Erselrope
wars when the arms business was booming. <br>
SALESMAN [on viewscreen] So lock on to my signal and beam on down,
because we don't just provide weapons <br>
PICARD: Shut that off. <br>
SALESMAN [on viewscreen]: We provide complete weapons systems. <br>
LAFORGE: It's a heck of a sales pitch. <br>
PICARD: If an automated message system is still functioning, there
could be other systems on that planet that are still operational. <br>
TASHA: Weapons systems? <br>
PICARD: Possibly. <br>
RIKER: We're going to have to go down there to find it. <br>
PICARD: Number One, prepare am away team. <br>
RIKER: Lieutenant Yar. Data. <br>
TASHA: Commander, I recommend a minimum complement. <br>
RIKER: Oh? I would have thought otherwise. <br>
TASHA: We'll keep the first landing party small and mobile, until I'm
confident that whatever killed the inhabitants of this planet isn't
still down there. <br>
RIKER: Okay. </font></p>

CRUSHER: The wound needs a clotting agent. <br>
PICARD: I couldn't find your medical kit. <br>
CRUSHER: Those roots. What are they? <br>
PICARD: Roots? What, these? <br>
CRUSHER: Break off a piece and taste it. Don't swallow it. <br>
PICARD: Very bitter. <br>
CRUSHER: Apply some to your hand. Is there a colour change? <br>
PICARD: It's turning yellowish. <br>
CRUSHER: Good. Now, spread as much of it as you can onto the wound. <br>
PICARD: Hey, hey, Doctor. Now, stay awake. You've got to help me. I
need your help. All right, now listen. Your patient has lost a great
deal of blood from multiple lacerations. <br>
CRUSHER: The patient's going into shock. <br>
PICARD: So what do I do? <br>
CRUSHER: Elevate the legs and try to keep her warm. <br>
PICARD: Good. All right. Stay with me, Doctor. Keep talking. <br>
CRUSHER: You didn't happen to bring a blanket with you, did you? <br>
PICARD: No. I'm going to look for a way out. Now, you keep up your end.
Stay awake.

TROI: I know, but as Counsellor I have a duty to evaluate the emotional
fitness of the crew. <br>
LAFORGE: And you sense I'm nervous. Well, you're right. Counsellor,
deep down I'm shaking. I'm about to take this ship into battle, and
there's a good chance she'll be blasted out of the sky. I'm taking a
huge risk here, and there are a lot of lives at stake. So, yeah, I'm
nervous. Did you expect otherwise? <br>
TROI: Not at all. You're under tremendous pressure, more than you've
ever experienced. <br>
LAFORGE: You think I'm about to crack? <br>
TROI: On the contrary. You should be proud of the way you're handling
command. You've kept a cool head, taken charge, and made some very
difficult decisions. <br>
LAFORGE: Then what did you want to see me about? <br>
SOLIS [OC]: Lieutenant La Forge. Battle bridge is manned and ready.
However, deflectors have not yet returned to full efficiency. <br>
LAFORGE: Let's get them there, Mister Solis. <br>
SOLIS [OC]: Aye, sir. <br>
LAFORGE: I'll join you shortly. La Forge out. <br>
TROI: Did you hear the uneasiness in his voice? <br>
LAFORGE: Solis is doing a fine job. <br>
TROI: Yes, but he isn't handling the stress as well as you are. Both he
and Ensign T'Su are very young. <br>
LAFORGE: No, wait. They're good officers. <br>
TROI: Yes, but they lack battle experience. They're worried about
making mistakes, and they need some encouragement. <br>
LAFORGE: What do I do? <br>
TROI: Just remember it's you they draw strength from. They look to you
for guidance and for leadership. Help them. Show confidence in them. <br>

CRUSHER: My grandmother. <br>
PICARD: Your grandmother was a doctor? <br>
CRUSHER: No. <br>
PICARD: Oh. She was a botanist, then? <br>
CRUSHER: No. She helped to colonise Arveda Three. <br>
PICARD: Arveda Three? That's such a tragedy. Did she survive? <br>
CRUSHER: Yes. Once the medical supplies had run out, she had to use
what was at hand. So she learned all about roots and herbs, and then
taught it to me. <br>
PICARD: You were part of that colony. I didn't know that. But then
there must be a lot of things about you that I don't know. <br>
CRUSHER: Quite a few. <br>
PICARD: What? Now just a minute. Here's something odd. It's glowing. <br>
CRUSHER: What is it? <br>

It's a viewscreen. It seems to still be operative. <br>
(He presses a button and the whole wall lights up) <br>
PICARD: It's a tracking device of some kind. <br>
CRUSHER: Tracking what? <br>
PICARD: There are three moving indicators. Possibly the away team. <br>
SALESMAN: Beautiful, isn't it? It's the centrepiece of the whole unit. <br>
CRUSHER: Who's that? <br>
PICARD: A projection. It's the automated salesman who greeted us on the
Enterprise. What unit? <br>
SALESMAN: Why, the Echo Papa Six Oh Seven. Our proudest achievement.
The ultimate in weapons system technology. <br>
PICARD: Is that what's behind the attack on my people? <br>
SALESMAN: Impressive demonstration, isn't it? <br>
PICARD: Demonstration? It tried to kill us. <br>
SALESMAN: Versatile, powerful, and easy to use. The Six Oh Seven does
it all. Its various modules can gather information, neutralise ground
personnel, even destroy enemy space vessels. <br>
PICARD: The Enterprise. Is one of those things after my ship? Tell me. <br>
SALESMAN: Of course I can tell you. I am programmed to answer any and
all questions about the unit. I can talk terms, arrange for delivery,
whatever you need. <br>
CRUSHER: It doesn't understand anything other than what it's peddling. <br>
SALESMAN: The Six Oh Seven represents the state of the art in dynamic,
adaptive design. It learns from each encounter, and improves itself. <br>
PICARD: So what went wrong? Where are it's creators? Where are the
people of Minos? <br>
SALESMAN: Once unleashed, the unit is invincible. The perfect killing
system.&nbsp;<br>
PICARD: Too perfect. You poor fools, your own creation destroyed you.
What was that noise? <br>
SALESMAN: The unit has analysed its last attack and constructed a new,
stronger, deadlier weapon. In a moment, it will launch that weapon
against the targets on the surface. <br>
PICARD: Abort it! <br>

abilities unless we let it leave the nest. </font></p>
