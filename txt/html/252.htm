Stephen Hawking with the big grin on his face) <br>
HAWKING: But then I said, in that frame of reference, the perihelion of
Mercury would have precessed in the opposite direction. <br>
EINSTEIN: (laughing) That is a great story! <br>
DATA: Quite amusing, Doctor Hawking. You see, Sir Isaac, the joke
depends on an understanding of the relativistic curvature of
space-time. If two non-inertial reference frames are in relative motion
<br>
NEWTON: Do not patronise me, sir. I invented physics. The day that
apple fell on my head was the most momentous day in the history of
science. <br>
HAWKING: Not the apple story again. <br>
DATA: That story is generally considered to be apocryphal. <br>
NEWTON: What? How dare you! <br>
EINSTEIN: Perhaps we should return to the game. Let's see, where were
we? Yes, you raised Mister Data four, which means that the bet is, er,
seven to me? <br>
NEWTON: The bet is ten! Can't you do simple arithmetic? I don't even
know why I'm here in the first place. What is the point of playing this
ridiculous game? <br>
DATA: When I play poker with my shipmates, it often appears to be a
useful forum for exploring the different facets of humanity. I was
curious to see how three of history's greatest minds would interact in
this setting. So far, it has proved most illuminating. <br>
EINSTEIN: And profitable. <br>
NEWTON: Can we get this over with, please? It's your bet. <br>
HAWKING: I raise fifty. <br>
NEWTON: Blast! I fold. <br>
DATA: I fold as well. <br>
EINSTEIN: The uncertainty principle will not help you now, Stephen. All
the quantum fluctuations in the universe will not change the cards in
your hand. I call. You are bluffing and you will lose. <br>
HAWKING: Wrong again, Albert. <br>
(Hawking has four sevens and a king) <br>
EINSTEIN: Well. <br>

Ohniaka Three Outpost. They said they were under attack. <br>
PICARD: Ohniaka Three? There's no strategic value to that outpost. Were
they able to identify the attackers? <br>
RIKER: No, we haven't been able to raise them since the initial
contact. <br>
WORF: We are nearing the Ohniaka system, sir. <br>
PICARD: Bring us out of warp, Ensign. <br>
ENSIGN: Aye, sir. <br>
WORF: Sensors detect one ship orbiting the third planet. Its
configuration does not match anything in our records. <br>

WORF: No response, sir. <br>
PICARD: Put them on screen. <br>

RIKER: They might have attacked before we got here. <br>
PICARD: Or they might simply be another victim. What about the outpost?

unable to determine whether there are any lifeforms present. <br>

arrive to find the crew of the outpost are slumped over their consoles)
<br>
WORF: These wounds were caused by a forced plasma beam, similar to a
Ferengi hand phaser. <br>
RIKER: This seems brutal even for the Ferengi. Any sign of survivors? <br>
DATA: Electromagnetic interference is still making it difficult to get
a precise reading. <br>
RIKER: How many people were assigned to this outpost? <br>
WORF: Two hundred and seventy four. <br>
RIKER: All right. we're going to need to do a room to room search.
Worf, you and Corelki start searching the north wing. You and I will
take the south. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>

DATA: The mechanism appears to be jammed, sir. <br>
RIKER: There's not much damage. It doesn't look like they were
interested in the station, just the people. <br>
DATA: I have bypassed the primary system. <br>

starts. Data takes out the first Borg and at least three more turn up,
pinning down our heroes)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: They were fast, aggressive, almost vicious.
it was more like fighting Klingons than Borg. No offence. <br>
WORF: None taken. <br>
RIKER: There was another difference. I don't believe they were part of
the Borg collective. I think they were acting as individuals. <br>
PICARD: What? <br>
RIKER: One of them referred to himself as I. <br>
WORF: And that Borg also showed concern for a fallen comrade. He even
called him by name. <br>
TROI: The only Borg who had a name was Hugh. And we gave it to him. <br>
CRUSHER: Maybe Hugh has something to do with this change in their
behaviour. <br>
PICARD: Did they show any interest in assimilating you or your
technology? <br>
RIKER: They seemed more concerned with the death of their colleague and
with destroying us. I didn't see anything that suggested they wanted to
assimilate anybody. <br>
PICARD: The Borg's entire existence was centred around acquiring
cultures and technology. If that's changed, then they must have a new
objective. We have to find out what it is. Mister Worf, from this
moment on, I want to maintain a level two security alert. Post armed
officers on every deck. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Number One, I want you to analyse our sensor readings of the
Borg ship. Try to determine if it was something they constructed or an
alien ship which they captured. Then run an analysis of this subspace
distortion they used to escape. <br>
RIKER: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: I'm going to contact Starfleet Command.

Everything else looks fine. <br>
DATA: My internal diagnostic also finds nothing wrong. <br>
LAFORGE: I don't know, Data. There's nothing here that would indicate
anything that might cause an sort of behavioural anomaly. <br>
DATA: I agree. Geordi, I believe I've experienced my first emotion. <br>
LAFORGE: No offence, Data, but how would you know a flash of anger from
some odd kind of power surge? <br>
DATA: You are correct in that I have no frame of reference to confirm
my hypothesis. In fact, I am unable to provide a verbal description of
the experience. Perhaps you could describe how it feels to be angry. I
could then use that as a reference. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, okay. When I feel angry, first I feel hostile. <br>
DATA: Could you describe feeling hostile? <br>
LAFORGE: It's like feeling belligerent, combative. <br>
DATA: Could you describe feeling angry without referring to other
feelings? <br>
LAFORGE: No, I guess I can't. I just feel angry. <br>
DATA: That was my experience as well. I simply felt angry. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, let's say you're right and this is a real emotion. How
is that possible? <br>
DATA: I do not know. Perhaps I have evolved to the point where emotions
are within my grasp. Perhaps I will experience other emotions as time
goes by. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, I hope you're right. I'd hate to think that anger is all
you're capable of feeling. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Captain's log, stardate 46984.6. No additional
Borg attacks have been reported in the past two days. However,
Starfleet has dispatched Admiral Nechayev to take command in this
sector in preparation for a possible Borg invasion.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(the Admiral is a petite blonde) <br>
NECHAYEV: There will be fifteen starships in this sector by the day
after tomorrow. The Gorkon will be my flagship. You'll take command of
task force three, consisting of the Enterprise, the Crazy Horse and the
Agamemnon. <br>
PICARD: Understood. <br>
NECHAYEV: Captain, I've read the report that you submitted to Admiral
Brooks last year regarding the Borg you called Hugh, and I've been
trying to figure out why you let him go. <br>
PICARD: I thought that I had made that clear. <br>
NECHAYEV: As I understand, it you found a single Borg at a crash site,
brought it aboard the Enterprise, studied it, analysed it, and
eventually found a way to send it back to the Borg with a programme
that would have destroyed the entire collective once and for all. But
instead, you nursed the Borg back to health, treated it like a guest,
gave it a name, and then sent it home. Why? <br>
PICARD: When Hugh was separated from the Borg collective he began to
grow and to evolve into something other than an automaton. He became a
person. When that happened, I felt I had no choice but to respect his
rights as an individual. <br>
NECHAYEV: Of course you had a choice. You could've taken the
opportunity to rid the Federation of a mortal enemy, one that has
killed tens of thousands of innocent people, and which may kill even
more. <br>
PICARD: No one is more aware of the danger than I am. But I am also
bound by my oath and my conscience to uphold certain principles. And I
will not sacrifice them in order to <br>
NECHAYEV: Your priority is to safeguard the lives of Federation
citizens, not to wrestle with your conscience. Now I want to make it
clear that if you have a similar opportunity in the future, an
opportunity to destroy the Borg, you are under orders to take advantage
of it. Is that understood? <br>
PICARD: Yes, sir.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: For the past six hours, I have attempted to
produce an emotional response by subjecting myself to various stimuli. <br>
TROI: Like what? <br>
DATA: I listened to several operas known to be uplifting, I watched
three holodeck programs designed to be
humourous, and I made four attempts to induce sexual desire by
subjecting myself to erotic imagery. <br>
TROI: What happened? <br>
DATA: Nothing. <br>
TROI: I'm curious. Why are you ignoring the one emotion you've already
experienced? Why aren't you trying to make yourself angry again? <br>
DATA: Anger is a negative emotion. I wanted to concentrate on something
more positive. <br>
TROI: Data, feelings aren't positive and negative, they simply exist.
It's what we do with those feelings that becomes good or bad. For
example, feeling angry about an injustice could lead someone to take a
positive action to correct it. <br>
DATA: But my study of humanity indicates there are some emotions that
are harmful, such as jealousy or hatred. <br>
TROI: Those are very strong emotions, and you're right, very little
good can come from them. But I don't think that an exploration of anger
need necessarily lead to hatred or malice. <br>
DATA: But what if it does, Counsellor? What if it turns out that those
are the only emotions I am capable of experiencing? Would that not make
me a bad person? <br>
TROI: We've served together for a long time and I think I've come to
know you pretty well. I have to believe if you ever reach your goal of
becoming human, you won't become a bad one. <br>
DATA: I wish I were as confident as you, Counsellor. When I was
fighting the Borg, I felt angry, but when I think back on the incident,
I realise that I was also experiencing another sensation. It was not
the same as anger, but I think it was an emotion. <br>
TROI: When exactly did you feel this other emotion? <br>
DATA: It was just after I had killed the Borg. I looked down at his
body. I felt something. <br>
TROI: If you had to give this feeling a name, what would you call it? <br>
DATA: I believe it was pleasure.

CROSIS: If it is unethical to take pleasure from another being's death,
you must be a very unethical person. <br>
DATA: No. That is not correct. My creator Doctor Soong, gave me a
programme which defines my sense of right and wrong. In essence, I have
a conscience. <br>
CROSIS: It didn't seem to be functioning on Ohniaka Three when you felt
pleasure in killing that Borg. <br>
DATA: Step away from the forcefield. Your proximity is interfering with
my scan. <br>
CROSIS: You enjoyed it. That surge of emotion inside you as you watched
the life drain from your victim. It was unlike anything you've ever
felt before. <br>
DATA: It was a very potent experience. <br>
CROSIS: You'd like to feel that way again. <br>
DATA: Yes. <br>
CROSIS: You'd do anything to feel that way again, even if it meant
killing someone. <br>
DATA: No. That would not be ethical. <br>
CROSIS: You don't sound very sure of yourself. Is your ethical
programme functioning? Data? Do you have a friend? <br>
DATA: Yes. His name is Geordi. <br>
CROSIS: If it meant that you could feel emotions again the way you did
on Ohniaka Three, would you kill your friend? Would you kill Geordi? <br>
DATA: Yes. I would.

LAFORGE: Our current theory is that the Borg have established several
transwarp conduits through subspace. A ship, when entering the conduit,
is immediately accelerated to an extremely high warp velocity. It's
like falling into a fast moving river and being swept away by the
current. <br>
PICARD: How fast would a ship travel through one of these conduits? <br>
LAFORGE: We don't know. Normal subspace limitations don't apply to
transwarp variables. But I'd say based on the distance we covered
during our trip through the conduit, the speed would have to be at
least twenty times faster than our maximum warp. <br>
RIKER: How do they open the conduits? <br>
LAFORGE: The Borg ship emitted some kind of high energy tachyon pulse
just before we saw the subspace distortion. It seems as though the
conduits are keyed to respond to tachyon transmissions of a specific
frequency. <br>
PICARD: Is there any way for us to duplicate <br>
WORF: Captain, a shuttlecraft has left bay two. <br>
PICARD: Who authorised a launch? <br>
WORF: There was no authorisation. <br>
PICARD: Picard to shuttlecraft. Identify yourself and return to the
ship immediately. Mister Worf, lock on with a tractor beam and return
it to the ship. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. The tractor beam has been disabled. Command override is
not functioning. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain, I'm picking up a tachyon surge. Looks like whoever's
in the shuttle is trying to trigger the transwarp conduit. <br>
RIKER: Can we know who's on board? <br>
WORF: It is the Borg prisoner, and Commander Data. <br>
(a flash on the viewscreen) <br>
PICARD: Mister La Forge, can we follow them into the conduit? <br>
LAFORGE: We've got a pretty good reading of the tachyon pulse they
sent. We might be able to duplicate it. <br>
PICARD: The question is, is Data a prisoner or did he go willingly? <br>
WORF: The command overrides used to disable the tractor were Commander
Data's. <br>
RIKER: The Borg could have downloaded the codes from Data's positronic
net. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps Data's recent flash of emotion has something to do with
this. It could have affected him more profoundly than we realise.
Either way, we have to find him. <br>
LAFORGE: I've set up a temporary tachyon matrix in the main deflector.
I think I can use it to simulate the pulse sent by the shuttle. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, red alert. <br>
RIKER: All hands, battle stations. <br>
PICARD: Bring us to the last known coordinates of the shuttlecraft. <br>
WORF: Shields up. Weapons ready. <br>
PICARD: Mister La Forge? <br>
LAFORGE: Energising the matrix. Emitting tachyons in the lower
bandwidth. <br>
WORF: Sensors show no unusual subspace activity. <br>
LAFORGE: All right. Switching to the secondary bandwidth. Nothing.
Maybe if I try alternating the frequencies. <br>
WORF: Captain, there is an energy fluctuation directly ahead of us. It
is the subspace distortion. <br>
PICARD: Take us in, Ensign. One half impulse. <br>
(in they go, shake rattle and roll)<br>
WORF: Power levels are down to sixty seven percent. <br>
LAFORGE: Compensating with auxiliary power. <br>
(all calm again) <br>
PICARD: Report. <br>
RIKER: Navigational sensors show that we've travelled sixty five light
years from our previous position. <br>
PICARD: Can you locate the shuttle? <br>
WORF: No, sir. There is no indication of the shuttle within range of
our sensors. <br>
RIKER: Maybe we can find an energy signature from their engines. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain. <br>
PICARD: Yes, Mister La Forge. <br>
LAFORGE: I've scanned three different star systems within sensor range.
There is evidence of at least two advanced civilisations but I'm
reading no life signs. But there are indications that plasma weapons
have been fired in those systems recently. <br>
PICARD: The Borg have been busy. <br>
RIKER: I think we've found the shuttle's energy signature. <br>
WORF: They were heading two four seven, mark zero five nine. <br>
PICARD: Lay in that course, Ensign, and engage at full impulse. <br>
ENSIGN: Aye, sir. <br>
(in orbit of a mottled planet) <br>
RIKER: We've traced the shuttle's energy signature to this point on the
surface but there's too much interference to scan the location. <br>
PICARD: Are they intentionally jamming our sensors? <br>
LAFORGE: It looks more like a natural phenomenon. There's an unusually
high amount of EM interference in the planet's magnetosphere. <br>
PICARD: Can we transport through the interference? <br>
LAFORGE: We could, but there could be fifty Borg down there waiting for
us and we'd never even know it.
RIKER: I think we have to take the risk. <br>
PICARD: Agreed. Take a well-armed away team and transport down to those
coordinates. Have the transporter Chief keep a permanent lock on your
signals so we can get you out of there at the first sign of trouble. <br>
RIKER: Aye, sir. Mister Worf, you're with me.

RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. We're on the surface. There's no sign of
any Borg, or Data. The shuttle appears to be abandoned. <br>
WORF: The EM interference is limiting the tricorder range. It is
useless beyond one hundred metres. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Stand by, Number One. Assuming that they're
still together, how far could they have travelled in three hours? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, Data can move pretty fast even over rough terrain, but
based on what we know about the Borg, I don't think they should be able
to move any faster than you or I. They might have been able to get
fifteen or twenty kilometres from the shuttle by now. <br>
PICARD: Picard to Riker. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Riker here. <br>
PICARD: I'm going to start sending down other away teams. Set up a
command post and begin mapping out a search plan. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Understood, sir. <br>
PICARD: Picard out. I want to use the shuttlecraft for low level
reconnaissance. Have the designated pilots assemble at main shuttlebay.
<br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: And all available personnel, including you and me, will begin
to put together four man away teams. We'll leave a skeleton crew on
board the ship. <br>
LAFORGE: Who'll be in command of the Enterprise? <br>
(later) <br>
CRUSHER: Any last orders? <br>
PICARD: If the Borg should attack, don't wait for me or anyone else to
return to the ship but take the Enterprise to the transwarp conduit.
Return to Federation space. <br>
CRUSHER: Got it. Good luck, Jean-Luc. <br>
PICARD: Good luck, Captain.

your team searching section gamma two four. Worf and I will take theta

RIKER: Wallace and Towles. Ready? <br>

PICARD: Anything, Mister La Forge? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, no. Nothing, sir. <br>
PICARD: What if we modified the phasers to send out a luvetric pulse?
It might create a resonance fluctuation in Data's power cells. <br>
LAFORGE: Home in on that response with our tricorders. Yeah, I thought
about that. The only problem is that the pulse would probably have to
be so powerful that it would destroy Data's positronic net in the
process. <br>

TROI: Captain. I think I've found something. <br>

LAFORGE: Something's wrong. I can't get any kind of energy signatures
from these light sources. <br>

from our sensors. Let's go. <br>
