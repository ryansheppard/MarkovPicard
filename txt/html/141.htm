Captain's log, Stardate 42695.3. We are the first manned vessel to
enter the Selcundi Drema sector. Unmanned probes have recorded unusual
levels of geological activity in all five planetary systems. I am
hoping the Enterprise will find the answer to this enigma.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Commander, I've been reviewing the unmanned
probe scans. At some point during the last one hundred and fifty years,
the fifth planet of Selcundi Drema has shattered, forming an asteroid
belt. <br>
RIKER: I'd call that geological instability. <br>
WORF: Is there any indication that this is the work of an unknown
intelligence? <br>
RIKER: This is geology, not malevolence. These planets live fast and
die hard. The question is, why?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: You're sure you won't reconsider? <br>
TROI: No, I'll just watch you and be impressed. <br>
PICARD: An optimistic vote of confidence from a non-rider. <br>
TROI: You know, I never particularly thought of you as an animal
person. <br>
PICARD: Small animals, no, but horses. Computer, programme the holodeck
for a woodland setting, with a bridle path and an appropriate mount. <br>
COMPUTER: Type of mount? Andorian Zabathu, Klingon Sark <br>
PICARD: Horse. Earth horse. <br>
COMPUTER: Breed? <br>
PICARD: Arabian. The Arabs believed that Allah gathered the south wind
and made the horse. <br>
TROI: On the holodeck we've made that legend come true. <br>
PICARD: I like that. Oh yes, computer, English tack, and I will control
the animal myself. <br>
COMPUTER: Enter when ready.

TROI: So you like horses for the romance? <br>
PICARD: It goes deeper than that. A fine war mare would sleep in a
bedouin's tent, carry him into battle, feed his children with her milk.
There's a bond which is created by mutual need. Hello, beautiful. <br>
TROI: Now I understand. You don't want the comfort of a pet, you want a
companion. <br>
(Picard hands her his riding crop while he tacks up) <br>
PICARD: Thank you. I don't want to anthropomorphise anything. I seems
that some creatures have the capacity to fill spaces you never knew
were empty. <br>
TROI: I had a Betazoid kitten once. My mother and the cat reacted badly
to one another. <br>
PICARD: Sure you don't want to try? It's very relaxing. We can find you
something that will be quiet and gentle. <br>
TROI: No, I prefer a mode of transportation that doesn't have a mind of
its own. <br>
PICARD: Strange. I would expect Betazoids to be outstanding animal
trainers. <br>
TROI: We become too involved in the thoughts and shifting passions of
the beast. We lose our way and get swept up in emotion. <br>
PICARD: I should think the shifting passions of this beast would be far
more terrifying. <br>

RIKER: I'll need your advice and recommendations. As you know, I've
been given the responsibility of overseeing Wesley's education. To
further that goal, I would like to put him in charge of the planetary
mineral surveys. <br>
PULASKI: It's a big job with a lot of responsibility. <br>
RIKER: The game isn't big enough unless it scares you a little. <br>
LAFORGE: To do the job, Wesley's going to need a team. It takes command
presence to lead. Do you think he's ready for that? <br>
TROI: Leadership grows from self-confidence, which is also part of a
Starfleet officer's education. <br>
PICARD: All of this is true, but there is an old horse trainer's adage
about putting too much weight on a young back. We don't want him to
break under pressure. <br>
PULASKI: We seem to be shifting the focus here. Are we talking about a
young officer on the fast track to the Academy, or are we talking about
a young man that we are guiding through adolescence and into adulthood?
<br>
TROI: You can't guide someone into adulthood. The experiences are
unique to each person. Whether Wes succeeds or fails, he will learn
from the experience. <br>
PULASKI: I agree. I'm just questioning the speed at which we're moving.
<br>
LAFORGE: You think we're pushing him too hard? <br>
PULASKI: I think that's a valid concern. <br>
PICARD: Tempering is taken to extremes. <br>
PULASKI: He is a boy, not a sword. <br>
PICARD: Who will one day be a man and, to extend the metaphor, will
need a fine edge that won't dull at the first touch of resistance. <br>
RIKER: Sooner or later he'll have to feel the burden of command. Ensign
Crusher.

PICARD: These officers are here to assist you. Not judge, help you. You
should make use of them. They are a valuable resource. And by the way,
I respect an officer who is prepared to admit ignorance and ask a

Hildebrandt for volcanology and geomechanics. I want Davies for

are growing to form perfectly aligned lattices. <br>

RIKER: Sir, Data's out there right now, monitoring the conditions on
Drema Four. The situation's become pretty desperate for his
friend. He's calculated the safest location on the planet's surface.
You can guess why. <br>
PICARD: We're just keep getting deeper and deeper in, aren't we? <br>
RIKER: She's going to die. They're all going to die. <br>
PICARD: Unless. <br>
RIKER: Yes. Unless. <br>
PICARD: All right, you can tell Commander Data he has my permission to
contact his friend and conduct her to a safer location. Number One, you
know where we are now? <br>
