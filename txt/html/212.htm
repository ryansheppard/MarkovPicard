<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEIKO: It's a chipped cup, off-white, with a crack
in it. I can see it but I don't remember anything else about it. <br>
TARMIN: (a silver haired man) When you see it, do you hear any sounds? <br>
KEIKO: No, I don't think so. Wait, yes. Humming. Someone's humming. <br>
TARMIN: A woman? <br>
KEIKO: Yes, but I don't know who it is. <br>
TARMIN: Try to touch the cup. <br>
KEIKO: It has a sharp edge where it's chipped. <br>
TARMIN: Is there anything inside the cup? <br>
KEIKO: A liquid, dark. <br>
TARMIN: Like tea? <br>
(seeing herself dipping her finger into it) <br>
KEIKO: It's not hot. It's bitter. <br>
TARMIN: There's something else inside the cup. <br>
KEIKO: Yes, a wooden handle. <br>
TARMIN: A spoon? <br>
KEIKO: No, it's more delicate than that. <br>
TARMIN: Reach out for it. <br>
KEIKO: A brush. An ink brush. I hear that humming again. <br>
TARMIN: Keep listening to it, and hold out the brush. See if anyone
takes it from you. <br>
KEIKO: It's Obaachan! My grandmother. She's doing ink brush writing. I
can remember it now. She used that cup for cleaning the brushes, and it
was my job to fill it with water and bring it to the table. I would sit
beside her and watch the most beautiful characters come from that
brush. And the whole time, she'd be humming to herself. I remember it
like it was yesterday. <br>
CRUSHER: That is remarkable. You remembered such vivid detail. <br>
KEIKO: For years I've seen that old cup in my memory but I could never
remember what it was or why it was important. Thank you. <br>
TARMIN: You're entirely welcome, young lady. Perhaps someone else would
care to try? (to Beverly) You, madam. You're thinking of that first
childhood kiss. Would you like to remember more about it? <br>
JEV: Father, you know you're not supposed to probe someone's memory
unless they've given you permission. <br>
TARMIN: You are right, but sometimes with a beautiful woman, I can not
help myself. <br>
LAFORGE: How about you, Commander? Got any memories you feel like
digging up? <br>
RIKER: None that I'd care to share with an audience. <br>
KEIKO: It's getting late. I'd better be going. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: It is perplexing to me that the Ullians'
ability to retrieve memory is so highly prized. If an event were
important enough to be recovered, why would it have been forgotten? <br>
LAFORGE: It's not quite the same for us as it is for you, Data. You
record every second of every moment of your life. <br>
DATA: That is correct. <br>
LAFORGE: And then if you want to recall any one of those moments, you
just access the proper memory circuit. <br>
DATA: My understanding of the human brain suggests that the process is
the same for you. Each memory is encoded in chains of molecules. If you
want to retrieve it, you simply access the proper RNA sequence. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, that's true. <br>
DATA: Then in what way is it different? <br>
LAFORGE: Sometimes there are memories we just can't access at the spur
of the moment. For instance, I have no recollection of how I spent my
last birthday. Birthdays are important occasions, and you would think
that I'd remember how I spent the day, but right now I can't even
remember where I was.

everything about the time I got my first pet. A Circassian cat. I was
eight. I remember how funny-looking he was. I remember how excited I
was. It's as if it happened last week. <br>
DATA: Perhaps you remember the pleasant memories and forget the
unpleasant ones? <br>
LAFORGE: No, sometimes the bad memories can be the most intense of all.
<br>
DATA: It would seem there is no predictable pattern to human memory. <br>
LAFORGE: It would seem.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JEV: This library of ours has been in the planning
stages for years. A collection of the retrieved memories of races from
many different star systems. <br>
TARMIN: What my son means to say is, we think of ourselves as
archaeologists of the mind. We believe that the history of a
world is contained in the personal experience of its people. <br>
PICARD: Rather like the ancient oral historians on Earth. <br>
TARMIN: Exactly. The library we propose will be a vast storehouse of
these individual memories. <br>
RIKER: That sounds like quite a project. How long will it take to
finish your studies on Kaldra? <br>
INAD: (a silver-haired woman) Many months. We've been working for
years, and we've surveyed only eleven planets in eight star systems. <br>
JEV: But it's our way of life. We wouldn't want to do anything else. <br>
CRUSHER: Captain, Mister Tarmin gave us a demonstration of his
abilities this afternoon. It's fascinating. Perhaps you would like to
resurrect some memories. <br>
TARMIN: I'd be happy to probe your recollections, Captain. Most people
find it an enjoyable experience. <br>
PICARD: I'm sure. However, I don't think I would make a particularly
good subject. <br>
CRUSHER: I'm sure you'd be ideal, and you must have some intriguing
memories. <br>
TARMIN: We won't be on your ship for long. This may be your last
chance. <br>
PICARD: Yes. Well. <br>
INAD: Tarmin, we mustn't influence people. We must let them come to us
willingly. <br>
TARMIN: I have found over the years there are many who want the
experience of memory retrieval, but who lack some encouragement in
order to come forward. <br>
TARMIN: You, Mister Worf? I would love to explore Klingon memories. <br>
WORF: Klingons do not allow themselves to be probed. <br>
TARMIN: But there is nothing to fear. <br>
JEV: Father. <br>
WORF: I am not fearful. <br>
TARMIN: Commander La Forge, you? <br>
LAFORGE: I don't think so. Thanks anyway. <br>
TARMIN: I have rarely encountered such squeamish people. Doctor
Crusher? Commander Riker? <br>
TROI: Mister Tarmin, are all Ullians able to read memories? <br>
TARMIN: Oh, no, my dear. The technique requires special training. It is
a serious commitment. <br>
INAD: It takes years of study. Tarmin is the most proficient of our
group. <br>
TARMIN: Once Jev spent two days with a contingent of elderly Gentons.
He couldn't get anything from them. I spent only one hour with them and
retrieved a fragment from the Gentonian trade wars. <br>
JEV: Excuse me. <br>
(Jev exits hurriedly) <br>
INAD: Exactly how long will it be before we reach Kaldra, Captain? <br>
PICARD: Mister Data? <br>

CRUSHER: I've tried standard revival techniques. She doesn't respond.
Until I find out what's caused this, I don't want to try anything more
extreme. <br>
RIKER: Do we know what she was doing when this happened? <br>

talk to him. <br>

you. You may have been the last person to see her. Did you go with her
into her quarters? <br>
JEV: Are you suggesting that I behaved improperly, Commander? <br>
RIKER: Not at all. I'm just trying to trace her steps. <br>

ill? <br>

RIKER: If you have no objections, Doctor Crusher would like to examine
you and your group. <br>
JEV: To what end? <br>
RIKER: She's just trying to eliminate the possibility that one of you
might be carrying an organism that was harmful to Deanna.

get to the bottom of the mystery. <br>

I've heard doctors say that even when someone's in a coma, they may be
able to hear when people talk to them. That it might help stimulate the
brain, speed the healing. In fact, I think you did that for me once,
when I was in pretty bad shape. I just thought it might help to hear a
friendly voice, even if you don't know you're hearing it. We've been
busy mapping the sector. It's been pretty routine. The most unusual
thing we've seen is a binary star system. Let's see, what else? I
finished the personnel review that we were working on. You can check it
out when you wake up. I miss you. Please don't stay away too long. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: I compared Deanna's brain scan to one that
I took during her last physical. There is a difference. This time
there's a trace of electropathic activity. <br>
PICARD: And Commander Riker? <br>
CRUSHER: I found the same pattern. If I didn't know better, I'd say
they both had Iresine syndrome. That's the only medical condition that
would produce that pattern. <br>
WORF: What is Iresine syndrome? <br>
CRUSHER: A very rare neurological disorder first diagnosed in the
twenty third century. It's characterised by an identical electropathic
residue. <br>
PICARD: Why discount the possibility that it's responsible for these
comas? <br>
CRUSHER: Iresine is always accompanied by a severely decreased
histamine count. Both Will and Deanna showed normal levels.
I've asked Commander La Forge to conduct a shipwide diagnostic to
determine any other agent that might cause the same electropathic
pattern. <br>
WORF: Commander Riker and Counsellor Troi were in perfect health until
the Ullians arrived. It would be wise to quarantine the aliens. <br>
PICARD: I believe that it would be premature to take that action,
Mister Worf. There's no real evidence linking these comas with the
Ullians. <br>
CRUSHER: That's true, but there is something curious. The electropathic
residue I discovered is located in the thalamus. That's the area of the
cerebral cortex that involves memory function.

COMPUTER: Bilenium and tarrisite are not present. <br>
LAFORGE: Do any of the substances break down into by-products that are

DATA: We seem to have eliminated the all known factors that may have
caused the comas, except for the Ullians. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, I want you to investigate those eleven planets
that the Ullians visited. See if there were any reports of unexplained
comas. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: In the meantime, we must consider restricting them to their
quarters, as a precautionary measure. <br>
LAFORGE: If one of them is behind this, will keeping telepaths in their
quarters prevent it from happening again? <br>
PICARD: What else can we do? Station a guard? Set up a force field? I
don't see that those would be any more effective. <br>

produced by the Ullians' telepathic activity. I'm going to talk to
them, and in the meantime, you're to stay here and recuperate. And if
you remember anything at all about what happened, I want you to tell me

unraveled this mystery. <br>
TARMIN: We're to be prisoners? <br>
JEV: Father. <br>
PICARD: No, please don't look on it like that. We have done everything
we can to explain these comas. We have performed physical examinations,
and neurological scans. We have conducted a ship-wide diagnostic,
looking for viruses, parasites, infestations. We have investigated
every possible cause we can imagine. We have found nothing. Nothing to
explain these comas. The only variable that we have not been able to
eliminate is your presence here on this ship. Now, in the light of our
actions, we would ask you to understand my request and to agree to it. <br>
JEV: Captain, our history indicates that we do not adversely affect the
people we contact. <br>
PICARD: I know that. <br>
JEV: Then are you implying an intentional assault? <br>
PICARD: I'm simply considering all possibilities. <br>
JEV: Surely you would give us the chance to prove that we are innocent?
<br>
PICARD: If that's possible, of course. <br>
JEV: Then I would propose doing a memory probe of Counsellor Troi. You
have said that she doesn't remember anything that happened before she
lapsed into unconsciousness. I could retrieve that memory There is a
possibility that it could explain the coma and prove our innocence. <br>
PICARD: I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly subject Counsellor Troi to a
potentially dangerous procedure. <br>
TARMIN: And I refuse to be a party to any of these proceedings. <br>
(Tarmin leaves) <br>
INAD: Jev is making a reasonable request, Captain. If we're to be
accused, surely we're entitled to a defence? Tarmin did a memory probe
on another of your crew. Has she suffered any ill effects? <br>
PICARD: No. <br>
INAD: And neither will Counsellor Troi. Please, you may have as many
people here as you need to guarantee her safety, but give us this
chance to vindicate ourselves. <br>

LAFORGE: Well, that's it for Melina Two. No unexplained comas during
the time the Ullians were working there. <br>
DATA: We have yet to receive transmissions from the two planets of the
Nel system. Perhaps they will show different results. <br>
LAFORGE: Maybe. Or maybe we're not checking for the right thing. <br>
DATA: Please clarify. <br>
LAFORGE: We haven't look into the comas that were explained. <br>
DATA: Why would we do that? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, remember what Doctor Crusher said right after Counsellor
Troi became unconscious? That it looked exactly like Iresine syndrome
except for the histamine count? <br>
DATA: Yes. <br>
LAFORGE: Maybe not every medical facility is as careful as Doctor
Crusher. Maybe it's easier to just make a quick diagnosis rather than
to keep hunting for the real cause. <br>
DATA: You are searching for instances of Iresine syndrome? <br>
LAFORGE: Right, and correlating them with visits by the Ullians. And
there we are. <br>
DATA: Two cases of Iresine syndrome on Hurada Three, at exactly the
time Tarmin and his group was there. <br>

here.
