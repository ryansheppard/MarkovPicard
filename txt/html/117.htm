Captain's log, stardate 41463.9. While mapping the Pleiades Cluster,
we've been asked by the Federation to visit a group terraforming Velara
Three. Communications have been erratic and there is some concern about
their welfare.

be. <br>
RIKER: I've always wanted to see terraforming in operation. <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant Yar, hailing frequencies. <br>
TASHA: Hailing frequencies open, sir. <br>
PICARD: Velara Three base, this is Captain Picard of the starship
Enterprise. (silence)<br>
TASHA: No malfunctioning equipment on either side, sir. They are
receiving us. <br>
PICARD: Velara Three base, this is the Enterprise. Come in please.
Over. <br>
LAFORGE: Maybe no one's home. <br>
DATA: We are sensing life-forms, sir. <br>
PICARD: Velara Three base, do you copy? <br>
(A middle-aged man with a slight East European accent. Everyone say Hi!
to General Gogol from the James Bond films) <br>
MANDL [on viewscreen]: Velara base to Enterprise. Yes, Captain, I'm
Director Mandl. I'm sorry about the delay, but we weren't expecting
visitors. <br>
PICARD: Terraform Command has asked us to see how you were getting
along. <br>
MANDL [on viewscreen]: We were a little behind, but we're back on
schedule. I'd like to hope we'd be allowed to maintain that schedule. <br>
TROI: We alarm him for some reason. <br>
PICARD: Your staff is all well, I presume, Director? <br>
MANDL [on viewscreen]: Understandably tired. We're working very hard,
Captain. <br>
PICARD: If there anything we can do to help? You and your staff are
welcome aboard for a change of scene, rest. <br>
RIKER: We have some holodecks which you might enjoy. <br>
MANDL [on viewscreen]: No disrespect, sir, but we cannot afford the
time. <br>
COMPUTER: Channel closed. <br>
TROI: His fear is escalating. <br>
MANDL [on viewscreen]: If you will excuse me, sir, I really must get
back to work. <br>
TROI: I sense deliberate concealment, sir. <br>
PICARD: Of what? <br>
TROI: I don't know, but it's intense. <br>
PICARD: (channel open) Director Mandl, we've heard of your remarkable
achievements in terraforming. My crew would very much appreciate
looking around. <br>
MANDL [on viewscreen]: This is not really the best time. We are at a
very critical phase just now. <br>
PICARD: We would require no special attention. <br>
MANDL [on viewscreen]: I'm trying not to be rude, sir, but this is
really very inconvenient. <br>
(channel closed) <br>
TROI: He is concealing something. It's more than just being too busy.
Your announcement about coming down has sent him almost to a point of
panic. <br>
PICARD: Well, whether he wants us or not. (channel open) Director
Mandl, unless you're absolutely refusing permission for us to land at
your station, prepare to receive our away team. <br>
MANDL [on viewscreen]: As you wish. <br>
PICARD: Counsellor, perhaps you'd better go along as well. <br>
TROI: Aye, sir. <br>

toes, Number One. </font></p>

LUISA: Welcome to Velara Three. Please. I want you to remember it as it
is now, because in a couple of decades you won't recognise it. Luisa
Kim. Gardener of Edens. <br>
RIKER: Commander William Riker, USS Enterprise. This is Counsellor
Troi, Lieutenant Yar, Lieutenant La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Data. <br>
LUISA: Arthur Malencon, hydraulics specialist, (bald, middle-aged) and
Bjorn Benson, Chief Engineer. (younger, blond) <br>
BENSON: An android? <br>
TASHA: And third in command of the Enterprise. <br>
BENSEN: Where were you manufactured? Are there others like you? <br>
DATA: Both matters are subjects of protracted discussion. <br>
BENSEN: Remarkable. Excuse me. <br>
(The two men go back to work) <br>
LUISA: We don't get many visitors. It's exciting to have you here. <br>
RIKER: We weren't sure how we would be received. Director Mandl was
less than enthusiastic about our interest. <br>
LUISA: I should apologise for him. We are at a critical phase. Usually
he's quite charming. <br>
RIKER: We'll try to stay out of the way. We've never seen a
terraforming station, and we appreciate the opportunity. <br>
LUISA: How much do you know about the process? <br>
DATA: Theories, reports, but nothing first-hand. <br>
LUISA: Oh, wonderful. Let me show you what we do. Newcomers find this <br>
TROI: The other two are secretive, but she is as open as she appears. <br>
LUISA: What we're doing is so exciting, so inspiring. We take a
lifeless planet and little by little transform it into an M class
environment, capable of supporting life. Terraforming makes you feel a
little god-like. The first phase involves selecting the planet. That's
very important. It must have the right mass and gravity, the correct
rate of rotation, and a balanced day and night. The planet must also be
without life or the prospect of life
developing naturally. The Federation determines if that's so. Then, we
take over. This station is phase two. Phase Three involves water.
Usually we create basins using hydraulic landscaping, but the water on
this planet is subsurface, and extremely high in salt content. We are
just about to begin pumping and filtering the water, removing the salt,
oxygenating and replacing. Next, we introduce micro-organisms, and when
the process is complete eventually, we'll have a lush, arable,
biosphere. <br>
(in 30-35 years according to her display) <br>
RIKER: You make it sound poetic. <br>
LUISA: I think it's the best job in the universe. <br>
DATA: The efficiency of your hydraulic landscaping is quite elegant. <br>
MALENCON: It isn't yet, but it will be. Right now I'm disturbed by
erratic power surges in several of the servo-mechanisms that control
the hydraulic probes. <br>
LAFORGE: Could it be the increased conductivity caused by the high
saline content? <br>
MALENCON: That was my first thought, but I <br>
BENSEN: Arthur. The factors do not support that conclusion. <br>
(Mandl enters) <br>
MANDL: I'm Director Mandl, and I'm sorry about having been so abrupt
during our initial contact. Being isolated, one tends to forget the
social graces. Are you seeing everything that you want? <br>
TROI: What you're doing here is miraculous. <br>
MANDL: What we are doing here is working a difficult and demanding
timetable, and there will be no miracle unless Malencon here gets the
hydraulic probes back on line. We are set to step up to full conversion
immediately. Shouldn't you be in the hydraulic chamber, Arthur? <br>
MALENCON: Now? <br>
MANDL: Yes. <br>
MALENCON: All right, Kurt. <br>
DATA: Geordi, this appears to be the master subsurface pump. <br>
LAFORGE: You're right. Very impressive. <br>
DATA: This is interesting. The water table is a thin ribbon between the
sandy surface layer and the rocks below. <br>
LAFORGE: And those two surfaces follow that contour so precisely, the
water maintains a consistent depth between them. <br>
DATA: Which would require extreme precision from the probe controls. <br>
MANDL: Here we have something which may be of interest to you. A
vegetation graph. It is really the key centre for successful
terraforming. <br>
RIKER: Incredible. It's planned month by month, decade by decade? <br>
MANDL: Every single thing is specific and exact. You see grand,
romantic concepts. I see unyielding rock under an ocean of sand. <br>
TROI: Commander! <br>
RIKER: What is it, Deanna? <br>
TROI: Malencon. He's in trouble! <br>
MALENCON [OC]: Help! Help! Argh! <br>(Screams and bangs.&nbsp;They run to the hydraulics room door) <br>
RIKER: Can you open it? <br>
MANDL: It's jammed. <br>
(A last scream, and then quiet. The door opens to reveal a burnt body
and a cylinder with a smoking hole in it. There is a laser in the room)

as a routine visit to a terraforming site has turned into something far
more serious. Arthur Malencon, the hydraulics engineer, has been

malfunctioned.

MANDL: How much more of this useless fantasy must I listen to? <br>
PICARD: None at all, Mister Mandl. Until this is sorted out, I've
provided temporary quarters for you and your staff. Perhaps you'd like
to make use of them. <br>
MANDL: You're overstepping your authority, Picard. You have no right to
interfere. <br>
PICARD: Mister Mandl, an attack on one of my crew gives me the right. <br>
MANDL: I have a schedule to meet. <br>

the Director to his quarters. <br>
TASHA: Aye, sir. <br>
(Mandl and Tasha leave) <br>
PICARD: Go on with your report. <br>
DATA: It would appear the laser's drilling system was reprogrammed,
sir. As soon as its memory bank received power, it turned itself on and
went after me. Fortunately, I was able to cope with it. <br>
LAFORGE: And not by much, from what I saw. <br>
DATA: I believe it was programmed to destroy any person moving in that

PICARD: Certainty? Or speculation? <br>
DATA: Certainty. <br>
LAFORGE: That would have required the talents of a master programmer. <br>
DATA: But it was done. <br>
PICARD: And so the question becomes not who, since it clearly was one
of the three remaining terraformers. The question becomes why? What are
they hiding? What could be so important that one or all of them, could
be desperate enough to kill? <br>

CRUSHER: As we're dealing with a fundamental question, let's use the
basic scientific method. Observe, theorise and attempt to prove it.
Activate. Let's be sure of what we're dealing with. Is the sample

it is picking up the electrical impulse of our systems. <br>

TASHA: Only the victim had the required expertise. Malencon did work
where the whatever it is was found. Trying to suppress that knowledge
would be motive for murder, if Mandl were obsessed enough. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Director Mandl, I put it to you again. What
do you know about these life forms? <br>
MANDL: Not a thing. <br>
PICARD: Enough! Sit down, Lieutenant. You are deliberately evasive and
it must stop. You have kept information from me since our first
communication. An alien life form has taken possession of my Medical
Lab. You knew of its existence. <br>
MANDL: Yes. <br>
LUISA: Is this true? You knew there was life on Velara Three? <br>
MANDL: I knew that there were random energy patterns, yes, I knew that.
But not life. Not by any definition I have ever heard. <br>
TROI: But you tried to keep that knowledge from us. <br>
MANDL: No! They are meaningless silicon crystals, which rebroadcast
sunlight. <br>
PICARD: It is a life form and it has intelligence. <br>
MANDL: Why do you say that? <br>
PICARD: It's trying to communicate with us. <br>
MANDL: Communicate with you? <br>
PICARD: When did you first become aware of them? <br>
BENSEN: Tell them about the pattern in the sand. <br>
PICARD: Oh, yes. Do tell us. <br>
BENSEN: When we first arrived, we noticed that in certain areas the
sand had a sparkling effect, like sunlight bouncing off new fallen snow.<br>
PICARD: What did you think it was? <br>
BENSEN: Honestly, we did not give it any thought. <br>
MANDL: Picard, I must point out again that we were assured, not once
but many times, by the best scientific minds in the Federation, that
this planet has no life. No life! And we were not looking, and
therefore we did not see. <br>
PICARD: All right. At first you dismissed it. But then you began to
understand that there was something that was different about them. <br>
MANDL: You can't know that. <br>
PICARD: Your apprehension suggested it, when we first arrived. Tell me
about these patterns. <br>
BENSEN: At first we thought it was just a natural phenomenon unique to
Velara Three. <br>
MANDL: Refraction and a thin atmosphere is interesting, but certainly
not life. <br>
LUISA: Why was I never told about this? <br>
MANDL: Because it's not particularly important. <br>
BENSEN: As the building of the terraforming station went forward, the
patterns in the sand ceased being random and became very specific.
Geometric shapes suddenly appearing, disappearing, changing location,
changing size. <br>
PICARD: Did you ever feel that these patterns were attempting to
communicate? <br>
MANDL: No, never. <br>
PICARD: Bensen? <br>
BENSEN: I don't know. At the time, I didn't think so. But now, after
hearing what you just said. Now, I don't know. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Captain, we've regained magnification of the life form.
It's divided again. <br>
PICARD: Patch visual to Observation lounge.<br>
(Eight round things with a bar pattern are on the screen) <br>
MANDL: There was no indication of any of this on Velara Three. <br>
BENSEN: Absolutely none. </font></p>

been the energy surge of a reproductive cycle.

like any computer <br>

areas of the ship, sir. <br>
PICARD: Data, any analysis of those bolts of light it emits? <br>
DATA: That seems to be it's method of reprogramming, Captain. Each bolt
of light consists of negatively and positively charged ions. A series
of programme instructions, as it were. It seems to have a quicker
rapport with our computers than we have. <br>
WORF: What do you expect? It is computer. <br>
PICARD: Have we disabled the Medical Lab computer console? <br>
RIKER: Aye, sir. As soon as Data determined the microbrain's method of
operation. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain, picking up a decrease in infra-red intensity. <br>
WORF: Maybe the life-form has reached its energy level. <br>
CRUSHER: Or maybe that's not the end of it. With single-celled life
forms, at least organic ones, cell division is preceded by a resting
state. <br>

PICARD: What was Malencon doing when he was killed? <br>
LUISA: There is a very thin layer of highly saline water under the
sandy top soil. He was siphoning that off. <br>
CRUSHER: Perhaps somehow that saline water sustained them. <br>
DATA: It connected them. <br>
LUISA: I don't understand. <br>
CRUSHER: The microbrains may be like our own brain cells. Individually,
a cell has life but not intelligence. Yet when interconnected, their
combined intelligence is formidable. <br>

they killed Malencon. <br>

tremendous amount of energy during its reproductive cycle. Yet there is
no discernible power drain on our own systems. <br>
PICARD: Then what is feeding the damn thing? <br>
LAFORGE: We found traces of cadmium salts. Now, cadmium is a conduit
for converting infra-red into electricity. <br>
