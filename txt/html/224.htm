ROMULAN [OC]: (heavy static) Main power failing. No way to stop the
overload. <br>
PICARD: Enterprise to Romulan vessel. We are en route to your position.
<br>
ROMULAN [OC]: Enterprise, what is your time of arrival? We are facing
an imminent core breach. <br>

MIROK: Yes. We had a forced chamber explosion in the resonator coil. <br>
LAFORGE: It's a pretty strange set up, but it looks like the graviton
field generator has been completely depolarised. There's no way to fix
it. It'll have to be replaced. <br>

VAREL: I've lost control of the containment chamber. <br>
MIROK: It's going to implode. <br>

Jean-Luc. The transporter could've beamed them somewhere else. The

would seen to indicate that there was a radiation surge from the
Romulan engine core which disrupted the signal. They never
rematerialised. <br>
CRUSHER: We should check again. There might be something that we've
overlooked and <br>
PICARD: Beverly, we've done everything that we can. <br>

peace with our former lives. That's what I was taught. We have to say
goodbye to the people who were in our lives. <br>
LAFORGE: No. You may be ready for the afterlife, but I'm not. <br>

never gave much thought to all the talk about borhyas. I figured that

DATA: I believe the cause of the accident may be related to the
explosion on the Romulan ship. <br>
LAFORGE: Really? <br>
BROSSMER: But that happened before we even arrived. <br>
DATA: In all likelihood, the explosion damaged the Romulan cloaking
device, causing it to discharge chroniton particles.
I am detecting a chroniton field in here. <br>
LAFORGE: A chroniton field? <br>
BROSSMER: If the particles were produced on the Romulan ship, why are
you detecting them here? <br>
LAFORGE: The transporter beam. <br>
DATA: I suspect they travelled through the transporter beam. That may
have been the cause of Geordi and Ro's death.
I will go to the Romulan ship. Perhaps I can discover the source of the
emissions. <br>
BROSSMER: Commander, are these chronitons dangerous? <br>

systems may be affected by prolonged exposure. When I return I will
devise a method to eradicate them. <br>

WORF: What kind of service? <br>
DATA: Captain Picard asked me to arrange a ceremony that was
appropriate. I have given a great deal of thought as to what is
appropriate in this instance. <br>
WORF: Sir, shuttlecraft four has not yet cleared the Romulan ship. <br>
DATA: Hold position here. <br>
LAFORGE: This is weird, listening to them plan our funeral. <br>
DATA: I find I am having difficulty deciding what kind of service to
have. Do you have any suggestions? <br>
WORF: Human custom is to conduct a solemn, dignified service in which
the dead are praised by their friends and loved ones. <br>
DATA: Ensign Ro was Bajoran. Her beliefs should be reflected as well.
However their death rituals are quite complicated. <br>
RO: Please, not the Death Chant. <br>
WORF: The Bajoran Death Chant is over two hours long. <br>
DATA: I am not certain that either human or Bajoran rites are fitting,
and I have researched the funerary customs of over five thousand
cultures to no avail. <br>
WORF: Shuttlecraft four has just cleared. <br>
DATA: Resume course. In almost all societies, it is traditional to say
a ritual farewell to those you call friends.
I never knew what a friend was until I met Geordi. He spoke to me as
though I were human. He treated me no differently from anyone else. He
accepted me for what I am. And that, I have learned, is friendship. But
I do not know how to say goodbye. <br>
RO: He seems almost human, doesn't he. <br>
WORF: Commander, I am not the proper person to advise you. <br>
DATA: Why? <br>
WORF: I am very happy for Commander La Forge. He has crossed over to
that which is beyond. For a Klingon, this is a joyful time. A friend
has died in the line of duty and he has earned a place among the
honoured dead. It is not a time to mourn. <br>

plan on being commemorated before my time.

MIROK: I'm afraid I fail to see the point of this investigation,
Commander. <br>
DATA: Chroniton emissions may have been responsible for the accident
which claimed the lives of our officers. <br>
VAREL: A most regrettable event, of course. <br>
DATA: Was your cloaking device damaged in the explosion? <br>
MIROK: All of our systems were damaged, including the cloaking device. <br>
DATA: That explains the chroniton fields I am detecting in here now.
For your own safety, it is important to eliminate those emissions. <br>
VAREL: Our safety? <br>
DATA: There is no way to predict what will happen when the chronitons
interact with the new engine core. <br>
LAFORGE: I've never seen anything like this. There's something in here
that looks like a molecular phase inverter. <br>
RO: What's that? <br>
LAFORGE: It's supposed to change the structure of matter so it can pass
through normal matter and energy. Hang on a second. A few years back,
we got intelligence reports that the Klingons were working on trying to
combine a phase inverter and a cloaking
device. In theory, they believed that a phased ship could hide
anywhere, even inside a planet, and that conventional weapons would be
useless against it. <br>
RO: How far did they get in their research? <br>
LAFORGE: It never got out of the preliminary stages. There were several
accidents. The Romulans might be pursuing the same
technology, trying to combine an inverter and a cloaking device. And if
this is the prototype <br>
RO: Then that would explain the explosion and the chroniton fields. <br>
LAFORGE: And us. <br>
RO: You mean we're cloaked? <br>
LAFORGE: Not just cloaked, phased. Our entire molecular structure
altered so that we don't have any substance. <br>
RO: Then that would mean we're not dead. <br>
LAFORGE: Yes. It would also mean that there's probably a way to
de-phase us. <br>

MIROK: Is their power transfer beam still at full intensity? <br>
VAREL: Yes. It will be until we're ready to switch to internal power. <br>
MIROK: We will set up a muon feedback wave inside the transfer beam.
The particles will accumulate in their dilithium chamber. When they go
to warp speed, their engines will explode. <br>

There must be a way to warn them before the ship goes to warp. <br>
DATA: This is puzzling. Three more chroniton fields have formed aboard
the Enterprise in the last hour. <br>
LAFORGE: There's no reason why the interphase device would be producing
new fields aboard this ship. <br>

sensor sweep for locations of all chroniton fields on the Enterprise. <br>

LAFORGE: Oh, yes they do. <br>
DATA: In fact, they seem to be appearing at random. <br>
LAFORGE: No, they're not. We were in every one of those locations.
Somehow we're leaving chroniton footprints behind us. <br>
DATA: Can you narrow the focus of the scan to pinpoint the locations? <br>
BROSSMER: Not with the internal sensors, Commander. <br>
DATA: Go to science station two on the main Bridge. Use a lateral
sensor array to get a more precise reading. I will modify an anyon
emitter to eliminate the fields once they've been isolated. <br>
LAFORGE: Why don't you go with her and see what the lateral sensors
turn up. I'll stay here with Data. <br>
RO: Right. <br>
(Data is scanning with a tricorder, then spraying) <br>
LAFORGE: Well that's interesting. You're reading chroniton readings in
here, but not from me? There's a field in this wall? Why? Data, I came
through this wall. I walked right through it when I came in here. When
the phased matter in my body passed through the wall, it must've
disrupted the wall's molecular structure producing a chroniton field.
Data, I'm right here that's me you're reading. Watch. <br>
(Geordi walks through the 'pool table' and Data detects the field) <br>
LAFORGE: Come on, it's me. You see?

PAREM: Do not move. Yes, I can see you. <br>
RO: Who are you? <br>
PAREM: Where is the scientific officer? The one like us. The one who
came with you to our ship. He spoke of a plan to return to normal. Yes,
this disruptor works. I was wearing it when I was changed. Now, where
is he?

LAFORGE: Data, stop being so rational. Try using your imagination once
in a while. These aren't just random patterns, it's me! <br>
(Data catches Geordi's hand with his spray) <br>
LAFORGE: Hey, watch where you point that thing. Wait a minute, Data, I
think you did something here . It's not so easy to push through any
more. The molecules in my hand must have been partially de-phased by
the anyon beam. Data, if a low level beam can bring my hand part of the
way back, maybe a high level beam can bring me all of the way back.
I'll just have to get you to turn up the beam intensity so that. Hey,
wait a minute, don't stop now. No, no, no. Data, don't give up on it.
It works, I was just creating more fields. Your method is fine. You
just need to turn up the intensity, Data.

MIROK [on viewscreen]: We are now on internal power. Captain Picard,
please accept my sincere thanks on behalf the Romulan Empire. <br>

Mister Data believes we shouldn't engage the warp drive until I've
cleared all the chroniton fields from the ship. <br>
PICARD: Very well. Let me know when you finished your sweep. <br>
BROSSMER: Yes, sir. <br>
RO: If we can get to the locations that she's decontaminating, maybe
the anyon emissions would re-phase us enough for someone to see us. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, well the beam strength would have to be pretty strong in
order for us to be visible for more than a millisecond. Somebody's
going to have to be looking directly at us. <br>

people. <br>

RIKER: It's time, sir. We should go. <br>
PICARD: You have the Bridge, Mister McDowell. I'll be at the service in
Ten Forward. <br>

chroniton fields in there as we can. Get them to flood that room with a
stronger beam.

first time I met Geordi La Forge. He was a young officer assigned to
pilot me on an inspection tour, and I made some off hand remark about
the shuttle's engine efficiency not being what it should. And the next
morning I found that he'd stayed up all night refitting the fusion
initiators. Well, I knew then that I wanted him with me on my next
command. Have you decided what you're going to say about Ensign Ro? <br>
RIKER: Yes, I have. It wasn't easy. <br>

Four and engage at <br>
BROSSMER [OC]: Commander Data, chroniton field strength in Ten Forward
has just increased by three thousand percent. <br>

DATA: It would explain the mysterious chroniton fields <br>
RO: Yes, yes, yes. <br>
DATA: If they were cloaked in some way. <br>
PICARD: Are you saying that they're still alive? <br>
DATA: If I am right, sir, they are, and in this room. Their brief
appearance coincided with the anyon sweep. Perhaps the anyons
neutralise the cloaking effect. Chief Brossmer. <br>
BROSSMER [OC]: Yes, Commander? <br>
DATA: Set the anoynic beam to its highest level and flood Ten Forward. <br>
BROSSMER [OC]: Aye, sir. <br>

can see them. The party grinds to a halt) <br>

further notice. There's a muon wave build up in the dilithium chamber. <br>

instructions. <br>
ENSIGN [OC]: Aye, sir. <br>

eating) <br>

wrong? <br>
RO: Nothing. <br>
LAFORGE: Come on. <br>
RO: I was raised with Bajoran beliefs. I even followed some of the
practices, but I never really believed in a life after death. Then
suddenly I was dead and there was another life, and it made me feel
like I'd been pretty arrogant to discount everything I'd been taught,
you know? Now I don't know what to believe. <br>

teach Ro Laren humility, it can do anything. </font> </p>
