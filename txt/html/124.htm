PICARD: No, no, Lieutenant, the advantage was yours. Come again. En
garde. <br>

DEAN: Interesting move, sir, but what technique was that? <br>
PICARD: The technique of a desperate man. <br>

DEAN: Interesting move, sir, but what technique was that? <br>
PICARD: The technique of a desperate man. <br>
DEAN: Captain, what was that? <br>
PICARD: Picard to Bridge. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Captain? <br>
PICARD: Number One, did something unusual just occur on the Bridge? <br>
RIKER [OC]: Yes, sir. We experienced some kind of loop where everything
repeats itself. <br>
PICARD: Here too. I'm on my way. </font></p>

Data. <br>

repeated itself exactly for everyone. <br>
LAFORGE: Just like a feeling of deja vu. <br>
WORF: Reports from all decks coming in, sir. <br>
DATA: Computers were also affected, which would indicate the phenomenon
was not an illusion but
occurred in real time. <br>
PICARD: Number One, find out if anything similar happened in this
sector. <br>
WORF: Sir, I am receiving an emergency transmission from the Pegos
Minor system. <br>
PICARD: Put it on. <br>
MANHEIM [OC]: Five four two point two. I repeat. This is Doctor Paul
Manheim. We are in need of help. Urgent. All ships, please respond. I
repeat. Coordinates are six six seven two eight point nine <br>
WORF: It is an automated signal, sir. I am unable to establish contact.
<br>
PICARD: Shut it off. Mister La Forge, lay in a course on those
coordinates. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. <br>
RIKER: Captain, you act as if there's a connection between the time
distortion and the distress signal. <br>
PICARD: There is. Paul Manheim. Fifteen years ago he went off to work
on experiments relating to non-linear time. It appears he may have
achieved some measure of success. Speed warp eight. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. Warp eight. <br>
PICARD: Engage. <br>
LAFORGE: Estimated arrival Pegos Minor, four hours, thirty five
minutes, seventeen seconds. <br>
RIKER: I've never heard of Paul Manheim. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data. <br>
DATA: A highly respected scientist, considered a visionary, he advanced
several time-related theories. One regarding the relationships between
time and gravity was quite intriguing. But neither that theory nor any
other
received wide acceptance. <br>
PICARD: Fifteen years ago, he assembled a team of scientists to expand
that research. They disappeared. Haven't been heard from since. <br>
RIKER: Did you know him, Captain? <br>
PICARD: I knew of him. He was teaching at the University when I was in
Paris, but I didn't have the pleasure. I must change. Number One,
inform me half an hour before we reach those co-ordinates. Keep trying
to determine if the time distortion was specifically located on the
Enterprise. <br>
RIKER: Yes, sir.<br>
TROI: Captain? Excuse me. <br>
PICARD: Yes, what is it, Counsellor? <br>
TROI: I think you would prefer to discuss this in private. <br>
PICARD: That's not necessary. Go on. <br>
TROI: When Professor Manheim's name was mentioned, you reacted with
intense emotion. <br>
PICARD: Yes. Please get to the point. <br>
TROI: I don't want to interfere with your personal life, but unresolved
strong emotion can affect judgement. <br>
PICARD: Well, thank you for your concern. <br>
TROI: As Ship's Counsellor, I offer my assistance. <br>
PICARD: What do you suggest? <br>
TROI: Confronting deep personal issues is not easy for you. You tend to
suppress them. There are a few hours until we arrive. Perhaps you
should use this time to analyse your feelings and put them into
perspective. <br>
PICARD: Thank you, Counsellor. If I should need you further, I'll let
you know. </font></p>

EDOUARD: Some wine, some cheese? <br>

EDOUARD: Perhaps what you hunger for is not on the menu. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps not. It was many years ago, I had a rendezvous. I was
to meet someone. Someone here, at this very table. <br>
EDOUARD: Your young lady, she did not come? <br>

GABRIELLE: The way you look at me, do I remind you of someone? <br>
PICARD: No. Yes, you do, somewhat. <br>
GABRIELLE: He's not coming. Why? What did I do to drive him away? <br>
PICARD: Maybe you did nothing. Maybe he had no choice. Maybe he was
afraid. <br>
GABRIELLE: Of what? Of me? <br>
PICARD: Oh, of being connected, rooted. Perhaps if he's as young as you

the freighter Lalo, as well as from a farming colony on Coltar Four.
Both described the same time distortion. The Captain of the Lalo
described it a hiccup. <br>
PICARD: Hiccup? <br>
DATA: Actually sir, that may be an incorrect analogy. <br>
PICARD: How so, Data? <br>
DATA: A hiccup is a spasmodic inhalation with closure of the glottis.
accompanied by a peculiar sound. If we were to continue this analogy to
a body function, what occurred would be best represented by a <br>
PICARD: That's enough, Data. Have you been able to learn more specifics
about the Manheim project? <br>
DATA: All I have found sir, is what you already know. Manheim was
concentrating on time gravity experiments when he left. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain, we've reached the coordinates specified. There's
nothing here. <br>
WORF: I'm receiving new coordinates. It's a relay signal. Same source
as the first one. <br>
LAFORGE: What are they, Worf? <br>
WORF: Six six four point eight by one three two three point seven by
four nine four nine point nine. <br>
LAFORGE: Very remote area, sir. It's in the middle of the Vandor
system, a binary star system. Main star's a B class giant, the
companion star's a pulsar. <br>
PICARD: Set course for the new coordinates, Mister La Forge. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. <br>
RIKER: Why is he making it this difficult to find him? <br>
PICARD: Hopefully he'll tell us, Number One. <br>
(Later) <br>
LAFORGE: We have reached the coordinates, Captain. <br>
DATA: Sensors indicate it is Vandor Four, a planetoid in elliptical
orbit around the binary system. <br>
PICARD: Standard orbit, Mister La Forge. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Give me a visual. <br>
WORF: Viewscreen on. There's a small forcefield on the planet. Latitude
twenty degrees, nine minutes north. Longitude forty degrees, two
minutes east of the present terminator. <br>
PICARD: Penetrable? <br>
DATA: No, sir. <br>
PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. <br>
WORF: Hailing frequencies open, sir. <br>
PICARD: This is Captain. This is the Captain of the USS Enterprise
responding to your signal for help. <br>
JENICE [OC]: Enterprise, thank you for hearing us. Where are you? <br>
PICARD: We're in orbit around Vandor now. <br>
JENICE [OC]: Then you can help me. I don't know what to do. It's only
the two of us left. He's having convulsions. Please. <br>
PICARD: Can you lock on to her coordinates? <br>
LAFORGE: No, sir. The forcefield is preventing any kind of contact
other than audio. <br>
PICARD: There is a force field at your location. <br>
JENICE [OC]: Yes. I know. <br>
PICARD: Good. But it is preventing us from helping you. Now, you must
find some way to shut it down. <br>
JENICE [OC]: I'll try. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: You said there were only two of you left.
What happened to the rest of the crew? <br>
JENICE: They were working in the second lab. Something happened there a
few weeks ago. They were all killed. It was a terrible accident. I
don't know exactly what happened. So many brilliant, wonderful minds,
just gone. <br>
DATA: Do you know the nature of Doctor Manheim's work? <br>
JENICE: Paul's always been interested in time. He's never believed that
it was immutable, any more than space is immutable. Over the last
decade, he came to believe that we reside in one of infinite
dimensions, and what holds us here is the constancy of time. Change
that and it would be what he called opening the window to those other
dimensions. <br>
RIKER: Which begins to explain what happened. <br>
JENICE: Have you been experiencing something up here? <br>
PICARD: Yes. What is emanating here is having repercussions light years
away, maybe even further. <br>
JENICE: That would explain his anxiety. I had no idea it had gone so
far beyond Vandor. <br>
RIKER: Why this place? Why Vandor? <br>
JENICE: All I can tell you about that is Paul and the rest of the team
searched for two years to find it. Vandor's exactly what they needed. A
planetoid around a binary star. <br>
DATA: Because of the dense gravity of the pulsar. <br>
PICARD: Did your husband ever attempt to define these dimensions, give
you an idea of what he expected? <br>
JENICE: No. But he did say that he was very close to proving his
theories. And then the accident. <br>
PICARD: Did he anticipate that these experiments might be dangerous? <br>
JENICE: I didn't think so. Now, in retrospect, he probably did. That
would explain all the unusual precautions he began taking, even before
the accident. The force field, the elaborate security system. Every
time he started a new experiment, he insisted that I stay in what he
said called a protected room.<br>
PICARD: Ah, and that's why you weren't affected. <br>
JENICE: Jean-Luc, he would never knowingly do anything to hurt anyone. <br>
PICARD: Yes, I believe that. <br>
JENICE: But as he saw his goal getting closer, seeming possible, he
became more and more obsessive. Maybe that clouded his judgement. This
is not how I imagined seeing you again. <br>
PICARD: Nor I you. <br>
JENICE: You've done well. A great starship in the far reaches of the
galaxy. It's everything you'd hoped. <br>
PICARD: Not exactly. Nothing works just as you hope. If you can't tell
us any more, I need to send a team down to the lab. <br>
JENICE: You can't. It's protected. One of the other scientists made
sure no one could get in. <br>
CRUSHER: Excuse me. <br>
JENICE: Is he worse? <br>
CRUSHER: He's resting. But I'd like you to undergo some tests as well.
My nurse will start them. <br>
JENICE: Thank you for your kindness, Doctor. <br>

PICARD: She's an old friend. <br>
CRUSHER: I gathered that. It's her husband I'm more concerned with at
the moment. <br>
PICARD: What's the prognosis? <br>
CRUSHER: I believe he's dying. His neurochemistry's been affected, but
I don't know how or why. I've never encountered anything like it
before. <br>
RIKER: How long does he have? <br>
CRUSHER: Maybe a couple of days. It's hard to predict. All I can do is
maintain him or attempt to maintain him until I find out what's causing
the damage. <br>

Otherwise, very little to clarify the situation. <br>

PICARD: What's it's source? <br>

method for harnessing energy from the pulsar. <br>
RIKER: It comes down to this, Captain. We've learned everything we can
from here, and we are no closer to understanding it than we were twelve
hours ago. Manheim is unable to help us, but hopefully, having been a
good scientist, he kept notes. <br>

source in the centre of this planetoid. We learned to enhance it, to
focus it. Everything worked too well. The energy from the pulsar, the
energy from the planetoid. We opened a crack, a window into another
dimension. <br>

PICARD: Oh, you want me to lie? <br>
JENICE: Of course. A nice, soft, painless lie. <br>
PICARD: Oh, I got the days confused. I thought it was Tuesday when it
was Wednesday. I went to the Cafe Moulin instead of the Cafe des
Artistes. <br>
JENICE: Ah, that's better. It was raining and you couldn't find a cab.
I waited all day. And it was raining. It rained the rest of the week. I
went to Starfleet headquarters looking for you, but you'd already
shipped out. So, come on, Jean-Luc. Let's hear the truth. <br>
PICARD: It was fear. Fear of seeing you, losing my resolve. Fear of
staying, losing myself. Fear that neither of these choices was right,
and that, and that either would have <br>
JENICE: For a long time, not a day went by when I didn't look up into
the sky, and wonder. <br>
PICARD: Each time that I returned to Earth, my thoughts were filled
with you. <br>
JENICE: I've thought a lot about this over the years, and perhaps
you're leaving out your greatest fear. The real reason you left. <br>
PICARD: Which was? <br>
JENICE: That life with me would have somehow made you ordinary. <br>
PICARD: You're wonderful. And am I that transparent? <br>
JENICE: Only to me. </font></p>

MANHEIM: It is only this. If anything should go wrong, please, take
care of her for me. <br>
PICARD: Of course. <br>
MANHEIM: She never would admit this, but she has had a terrible time
these last years. Had we not been so isolated, she might have left me,
and I never would have known. At least, not right away. Perhaps I'm not

in time. <br>
PICARD: Where we are, where we were, and where we will be. Data, I want
this to be an away team of one. You. I don't think there's any reason
to risk anyone else. <br>
DATA: It is reasonable, sir. After all, I am a machine and dispensable.
<br>
PICARD: Indispensable is the appropriate word. I think it should be
only you because you seem more able to control the effects of the time
distortion. <br>
DATA: Oh, I see, sir. That is quite true, sir. I see time as a
constant, whereas humans
perceive time as flexible. Hence the expression, times flies when
you're having fun, which until now has always confused me. <br>
PICARD: Well, I want you to put a stitch in time and, er, save much
more than nine. <br>

create additional problems and perhaps increase the danger. <br>

antimatter to rebalance and align the system. <br>
PICARD [OC]: Will that plug the hole? <br>
DATA: Theoretically, yes. In reality I do not know. <br>
(He opens a container and gets the antimatter, putting it on the end of
a long rod) <br>
DATA: When the effect hits, the forcefields will align, opening a clean
straight path to the other dimension. Whatever the time distortion, I
must add the antimatter at the appropriate moment. Geordi, if the
Professor was right, I will need a twenty seven second countdown. <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: You got it, Data. <br>
DATA: Captain, I now have the antimatter and am moving towards the
opening at the end of the lab. The next time distortion should occur
within seconds. Geordi, begin countdown on my mark. Now. <br>
(There's a big sparkle. Data looks back to see himself midway across
the lab - no 2 - and getting the antimatter - no 3. Meanwhile, Geordi's
voice is counting down, very echoy)<br>
DATA 3: Captain, there appear to be three of us. <br>
DATA 1: Should I drop the antimatter or wait for one of you? <br>
DATA 3: Only one of us is at the correct time continuum. <br>
DATA 1: Which one? <br>
