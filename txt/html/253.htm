(Data strangles a Borg) <br>
DATA: Stop. Stop. Stop. <br>
DATA: It was just after I had killed the Borg, I felt something. I
believe it was pleasure. <br>
RIKER: I don't believe they were part of the Borg collective. One of
them referred to himself as I. <br>
TROI: The only Borg who had a name was Hugh. <br>
HUGH [on monitor]: We are Hugh. <br>
PICARD: He was here in this room. I could have rid the Federation of a
mortal threat, and I let him go. <br>
LAFORGE: The Borg have established several transwarp conduits through
subspace. <br>
(the Bridge is boarded) <br>
SECURITY: Get down! <br>
(Worf shoots a Borg) <br>
CROSIS: I was like you once. Without feeling. But the One helped me. He
can help you too. He can help you find emotion. You will not resist
what you've wanted all your life. <br>
PICARD: If the Borg should attack, don't wait for me or anyone else to
return to the ship, but take the Enterprise to the transwarp conduit.
Return to Federation space. <br>
LORE: Stop! <br>
PICARD: Lore. <br>
DATA: The sons of Soong have joined together. And together, we will
destroy the Federation.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LORE: What do you think of my followers, Picard?
Impressive, aren't they? <br>
PICARD: I'm not particularly impressed. All you've done is teach them
to enjoy killing. <br>
DATA: You are wrong, Captain. My brother and I serve a much higher
purpose. <br>
TROI: Data, I can sense feelings in you. <br>
DATA: Yes. My brother has made that possible. <br>
PICARD: He gave you the chip. The one Doctor Soong made for you. <br>
LORE: No, no, no, no, no. I still have the emotional programme my
father designed. I wouldn't want to give it up. It's what has given me
such a strong sense of family, an intense desire to reunite with my
dear brother. <br>
PICARD: How did he do it, Data? What made you decide to come here? <br>
LORE: I am talking to you, Picard. I will tell you all you need to
know. <br>
PICARD: You're controlling him, and you've corrupted the Borg. <br>
LORE: You simply don't understand, do you? You have no idea what has
happened here. How I found my true calling. How the Borg found
something to believe in. <br>
PICARD: I would like to learn about that, but I want Data to tell us. <br>
LORE: I told you. I will tell you what you need to know. <br>
PICARD: How about that, Data? He won't even let you talk. <br>
DATA: Do not try to drive a wedge between us, Captain. I am loyal to my
brother. <br>
LORE: You see, Picard? He's not your pawn anymore. I've helped him to
break free, just as I've helped them. Look at them. Look at what I've
helped them become. They're no longer simply mindless automatons.
They're passionate. Alive. <br>
TROI: Are you saying that you caused them to become individuals? <br>
LORE: No, you did that. You and your friends. All I did was clean up
the mess you made when that Borg you befriended returned to his ship. <br>
DATA: Hugh interfaced with the others and transferred his sense of
individuality to them. It nearly destroyed them. <br>
PICARD: Data, do you remember when Hugh was on the Enterprise? Do you
remember what you were like then? <br>
LORE: That doesn't matter. <br>
PICARD: It does to me. I want to know what has happened to Data. <br>
LORE: What's important is what I've done here. How I found my calling.
I know now why I was created. No one can ever take that away from me.
Without me, they would have perished. When I stumbled on their ship,
they were lost, disoriented, they had no idea how to function as
individuals. They couldn't even navigate their own vessel. They had
lost their sense of purpose. I gave them their purpose. And they gave
me mine. <br>
DATA: The Borg aspire to the perfection my Brother and I represent.
Fully artificial life forms. We are their future. <br>
LORE: The reign of biological life forms is coming to an end. You,
Picard, and those like you are obsolete. Take them, brother. <br>

happened to you. The Data I know would never have agreed to be a
willing party to Lore's plan. <br>
DATA: (taking the comm. badges) I now realise that my life aboard the
Enterprise was a waste. My quest to become human was misguided. An
evolutionary step in the wrong direction. <br>
TROI: Data, all I'm sensing from you is anger and hatred. Have you felt
any other emotions? <br>
DATA: There are no other emotions. <br>
LAFORGE: Data, just because you haven't experienced certain emotions
doesn't mean they don't exist. Lore is only feeding you the negative
ones. <br>
DATA: Counsellor Troi told me herself that feelings are not negative or
positive. It is how we act on them that makes them good or bad. <br>
PICARD: Fine. But what about the things that Lore is proposing? What
about the lives that have already been lost? <br>
DATA: You simply do not understand. In a quest such as ours, sacrifices
have to be made. It is regrettable, but the greater good must be
served. Give me your visor. <br>

as we can. Ensign, prepare a buoy and launch it when ready. <br>

TAITT: Launching buoy now, sir. <br>
CRUSHER: Lieutenant, scan for any Borg ships between here and the
planet. <br>
BARNABY: Sensors detect no vessels. <br>
TAITT: We have to assume the ship that attacked us is still in orbit. <br>
CRUSHER: How long will we have before they can detect us and intercept?
<br>
TAITT: If their sensors function as well as ours it could be as little
as thirty seconds. <br>
CRUSHER: Crusher to Salazar. How long will it take to get the rest of
the crew off the surface? <br>

Lieutenant, is there any way we can use the planet as a barrier to keep
the Borg from realising we're in orbit? <br>
BARNABY: We can enter orbit while they're on the far side of the
planet. And if we delay dropping out of warp until the last possible
instant, we could gain a few more seconds. <br>
TAITT: If your calculations are even slightly off, we'd hit the
atmosphere. <br>

brother. <br>
DATA: Here is the visor. May I ask why you wanted it? <br>
LORE: I thought it might look good on me. What do you think? Maybe we
should work on your sense of humour, brother. Actually, I was thinking
La Forge's implants might make him an ideal test subject for my
experiment. <br>
DATA: All the Borg you have experimented on so far have suffered
extensive brain damage. <br>
LORE: Using the humans to perfect the procedure will allow us to
prevent any further Borg deaths. <br>
DATA: I understand. <br>
LORE: Good. What is it? <br>
CROSIS: This Borg disconnected himself from the others. He would not
let me hear his thoughts. <br>
LORE: I've asked you to stay linked to Crosis at all times. You know
that, don't you? <br>
GOVAL: Yes. <br>
LORE: I know this must be difficult for you. I know how uncertain you
must feel. All of these sensations are new and they can be frightening.
Isn't that right? <br>
GOVAL: Yes. I have doubts. <br>
LORE: Of course you do. It's only natural. No one is going to blame you
for that. But in order to lose those doubts, to keep you from fear and
confusion away, I need you to remain linked with the others so that
their strength and their confidence can help you. I need you, Goval. I
need you to help me build a future for the Borg. I can't do it without
you. Will you help me? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: Lore must have told Data to take my visor
because he realised I could see a carrier wave that was radiating from
him. <br>
PICARD: A carrier wave? Is that how he's manipulating Data? <br>
LAFORGE: I think what's happening is that Lore is tapping into the chip
he stole from Doctor Soong and somehow he's found a way to transmit
part of that emotional programme to Data. <br>
TROI: But the only emotions Data seems to feel are negative. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, I'm sure that's intentional. But in order for Data to be
affected by those emotions, Lore would have had to disable his ethical
programme first. <br>
PICARD: Can we reactivate it? <br>
LAFORGE: If I can generate a phased kedion pulse at the right
frequency, that would trigger Data's subsystems and reboot the
programme. <br>
PICARD: And although Lore would still be feeding him negative emotions,
at least Data might listen to us. <br>
LAFORGE: Right. <br>
TROI: I think it's worth a try. <br>
LAFORGE: So, got any ideas on how we generate a kedion pulse? <br>

HUGH: Why are you here, Commander Riker? Hasn't the crew of the
Enterprise caused enough damage already? <br>
(a little later) <br>
WORF: So you blame us for what has happened to the Borg? <br>
HUGH: You gave me a sense of individuality, changed me, then sent me
back to the Collective. You must have known that change would be passed
on to others. <br>
RIKER: We considered it. We knew it was a possibility. <br>
HUGH: Then you made it possible for Lore to dominate us. <br>
WORF: I cannot accept that. Lore is only one. The Borg could have
stopped him. <br>
HUGH: You don't know the condition we were in when he found us. Before
my experience on the Enterprise, the Borg were a single-minded
Collective. The voices in our heads were smooth and flowing. But after
I returned, those voices began to change. They became uneven,
discordant. For the first time, individual Borg had differing ideas
about how to proceed. We couldn't function. Some Borg fought each
other. Others simply shut themselves down. Many starved to death. <br>
RIKER: And then Lore came along. <br>
HUGH: You probably can't imagine what it is like to be so lost and
frightened that you will listen to any voice which promises change. <br>
WORF: Even if that voice insists on controlling you. <br>
HUGH: That's what we wanted. Someone to show us the way out of
confusion. Lore promised clarity and purpose. In the beginning, he
seemed like a saviour. The promise of becoming a superior race, of
becoming fully artificial was
compelling. We gladly did everything he asked of us. But after a while,
it became clear that Lore had no idea how to keep his promise. That's
when he began talking about the need for us to make sacrifices. Before
we realised it, this was the result. <br>
RIKER: What happened to them? <br>
HUGH: Lore began to experiment, trying to re-make us in his image. This
is the result of my encounter with the Enterprise, Commander. So you
can see I don't particularly welcome your presence here. <br>
RIKER: I'm sorry you feel that way. We just came to get our people. We
won't cause you any more trouble. <br>
HUGH: Tell me about my friend. <br>
RIKER: Friend? <br>
HUGH: The human called Geordi. <br>
RIKER: I wish I could tell you about him. We think he may be held
inside the compound. <br>
HUGH: I cannot help you. I cannot risk our being discovered. <br>
RIKER: Can you at least show us a way into the compound? <br>
HUGH: These caverns lead to tunnels which run beneath the compound.
Some of them connect with the environmental control ducts. <br>
WORF: Show us. If we can determine the geography of the compound, we
can form a rescue plan.

artificial neural network is able to take over your cognitive
functions. <br>

TAITT: Sensors still can't locate the Borg ship. I'm trying to filter
out the interference. <br>
BARNABY: We'll be within transporter range in nineteen seconds. <br>
TAITT: I'm starting to get sensor resolution. There's the ship. <br>
CRUSHER: We'll enter orbit here. <br>
BARNABY: Helm, new course, heading zero five two mark seven. <br>
HELM: Aye, sir. <br>
BARNABY: Stand by to drop out of warp in eight seconds. <br>
TAITT: Once we're in orbit, we should have about forty five seconds
before they intercept us. <br>
CRUSHER: Let's hope it's enough time. <br>
BARNABY: Emergency deceleration in five seconds. <br>
CRUSHER: Hold on. <br>
(whoomph) <br>
CRUSHER: Report. <br>
TAITT: We're in standard orbit, sir. The Borg ship is on the planet's
far side, and is moving to intercept. <br>
CRUSHER: Bridge to Transporter rooms. Begin evacuations. <br>
BARNABY: The Borg will be in weapons range in thirty two seconds. We
still can't locate Captain Picard's team and there's no sign of
Commander Riker or Lieutenant Worf. <br>
CRUSHER: Crusher to Salazar. Report. <br>

array. <br>
CRUSHER: Come on, Chief. It's now or never. <br>
TAITT: They're preparing to fire. <br>
CRUSHER: Raise shields. <br>
BARNABY: The port nacelle's been hit. <br>
CRUSHER: Helm, get us out of here. <br>
HELM: Aye, sir. <br>
BARNABY: We've lost warp engines. <br>
CRUSHER: Evasive manoeuvres, full impulse. <br>
(they sail past the massive Borg vessel) <br>
TAITT: Shields down to eighty percent. <br>
CRUSHER: Fire phasers. <br>
BARNABY: Direct hit. No damage to the Borg ship. <br>
TAITT: Shields down to seventy three percent. <br>
CRUSHER: What's the status of the warp engines? <br>
BARNABY: Still down. We can't outrun them. <br>
CRUSHER: Helm, set a new course, heading three four four mark six. Full
impulse. <br>
HELM: Aye, sir. <br>
TAITT: Sir, that heading takes us directly into the sun. <br>
CRUSHER: The databanks should contain information about a process
called metaphasic shielding. <br>
BARNABY: I know about that research. Commander La Forge was developing
a programme
that would implement metaphasic properties. <br>
CRUSHER: Right. How far along was he? <br>
BARNABY: It's in the databanks but it's never been tested. <br>
CRUSHER: If we had metaphasic shielding, we could enter the sun's
corona but the Borg ship wouldn't be able to follow. Can you bring the
programme online? <br>
BARNABY: I can, but we have no way of knowing if the shields will hold.
<br>
TAITT: Sir, hull temperature is rising. Now at twelve thousand degrees
C. Radiation level nearing ten thousand rads. <br>
(weapons hit) <br>
CRUSHER: Report. <br>
TAITT: Shields at sixty two percent. <br>
CRUSHER: Lieutenant, activate the metaphasic programme. It's our best
shot. <br>
BARNABY: Aye, sir. <br>
TAITT: Hull temperature is critical. We can't withstand this heat much
longer. <br>
BARNABY: Programme is online. Engaging metaphasic shield now. <br>
TAITT: Hull temperature dropping. Down to seven thousand degrees. <br>
CRUSHER: Maintain course. <br>
BARNABY: The Borg ship has broken off pursuit. <br>
CRUSHER: All stop. <br>
TAITT: Sir, the Borg ship is taking up position relative to ours.
They're going to wait for us to come out. <br>
CRUSHER: The question is, how long can we survive in here?

Lake. You remember that? <br>
DATA: I have a complete memory record of that day. <br>
LAFORGE: You decided to go swimming, and when you jumped out of the
boat you sank straight to the bottom. <br>
DATA: I did not have enough buoyancy to get back to the surface. <br>
LAFORGE: You had to walk over a kilometre along the bottom to get back
to shore. <br>
DATA: One kilometre forty six metres. <br>
LAFORGE: It took almost two weeks to get the water out of your servos. <br>

be able to forgive yourself for what you're about to do. <br>

their function. <br>

it's their own fault, isn't it? They should never have come here. What
were they thinking? <br>

LORE: Humans are so sentimental. <br>
DATA: I betrayed them. If they die, I am responsible. <br>
LORE: Why are you talking like that? Is something wrong with your

DATA: I do not want you to check my systems. I must resolve these
issues myself. <br>
LORE: I think I've made a mistake. I don't believe you can tolerate the
amount of emotion I've given you. Perhaps I should cut back a little. <br>

LORE: How's that? <br>
DATA: I do not like it. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BARNABY: Sir, metaphasic shielding is losing
integrity. <br>
CRUSHER: Can you stabilise it? <br>
BARNABY: No. We won't be able to stay in here longer than another three
or four minutes. <br>
CRUSHER: Do we have warp engines yet? <br>
BARNABY: Last estimate was another half hour. <br>
TAITT: Sir? I think I have an idea. I think it's possible we could
induce a solar fusion eruption that would destroy the Borg ship. <br>
BARNABY: What? <br>
TAITT: We need to direct a highly energetic particle beam onto the
sun's surface. That should produce a superfluid gas eruption. If we
target the right spot, the eruption would envelop the Borg ship. <br>
CRUSHER: How do you know this will work? <br>
TAITT: I did my senior honours thesis on solar dynamics. <br>
BARNABY: Excuse me, sir, but this isn't the Academy. And a student
thesis is a long way from a workable plan. <br>
TAITT: I've already configured the tractor emitters to create the
particle beam and I've located the target point on the surface. <br>
BARNABY: If her calculations are off, that eruption could encompass us.
<br>
TAITT: Well I'll just have to make sure my calculations are accurate,
Lieutenant. <br>
CRUSHER: Let's do it. <br>
TAITT: Yes, sir. <br>
(a beam lances out from the belly of the Enterprise) <br>
TAITT: The target area of the photosphere is destabilising. Pressure
wave expansion is accelerating. <br>
BARNABY: Subsurface fusion has been initiated. An eruption is forming
on the surface. <br>
(whoosh, kaBOOM) <br>
BARNABY: She did it! The Borg ship has been destroyed, sir. <br>

DATA: That is correct. <br>

Geordi? About what you and Lore are doing to the Borg? It tells you
