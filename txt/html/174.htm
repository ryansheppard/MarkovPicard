</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HANSON: The truth is, hell, we are not ready. We've
known they were coming for over a year. We've thrown every resource we
have into this, but still <br>
RIKER: Then you're convinced it is the Borg? <br>
SHELBY: (blonde woman) That's what I'm here to find out. The initial
descriptions of these surface conditions are almost identical to your
reports from system J two five. <br>
PICARD: Commander Riker wrote those reports. He agrees with you. <br>
HANSON: Commander Shelby took over Borg tactical analysis six months
ago. I've learned to give her a wide latitude when I want to get things
done. That's how I intend to operate here. <br>
SHELBY: My priority has been to develop some kind, any kind of defence
strategy <br>
RIKER: Obviously nothing we have now can stop them. <br>
SHELBY: We've been designing new weapons but they're all still on the
drawing board. <br>
HANSON: We expected much more lead time. Your encounter with the Borg
was over seven thousand light years away. <br>
PICARD: If this is the Borg, it would indicate they have a source of
power far superior to our own. <br>
SHELBY: I'd like to see the colony site as soon as possible, Captain. <br>
RIKER: It'll be dark there in thirty minutes. We've scheduled an away
team for dawn. <br>
PICARD: Number One, why don't you show the Commander to her quarters? <br>
RIKER: It's our poker night, Admiral. There's always an open seat for
you. <br>
HANSON: Another time, Commander. Your captain and I have a lot to
cover. But rumour has it Commander Shelby's played a hand or two. <br>
(Riker and Shelby leave) <br>
HANSON: Keep your eye on her, Jean Luc. She's one very impressive young
lady. <br>
PICARD: You seem rather taken with her, JP. <br>
HANSON: Just an old man's fantasies. When Shelby came into Tactical,
every admiral's uncle had a take on this Borg business. She cut through
it. She put us on track. <br>
PICARD: Earl Grey? <br>
HANSON: Please. She'd make you a hell of a first officer. <br>
PICARD: I already have a hell of a first officer. <br>
HANSON: Don't tell me he's going to pass up another commission? <br>
PICARD: One's available? <br>
HANSON: The Melbourne. It's his if he wants it. Hasn't he told you? <br>
PICARD: He'll make a fine captain, JP. <br>
HANSON: You may want to tell him that. We're still waiting on his
decision. This is the third time we've pulled out the captain's chair
for Riker. He just won't sit down. Let me tell you something, Jean-Luc.
There are a lot of young hotshots like Shelby on their way up. Riker
could suddenly look like he's standing still next to them. He's hurting
his career by staying put. If I were you, I'd kick him in the rear end
for his own good.

but we've tested the sections of the Enterprise's hull that were
damaged by the Borg. There were some unusual magnetic resonance traces.
<br>
RIKER: A Borg footprint? <br>
SHELBY: That's my theory. I'll see if it holds up tomorrow. I've
reviewed your personnel. I'll be assigning Mister La Forge and Mister
Data to accompany me on the away team. <br>
RIKER: I've already assigned them to the away team. And I'll be with
you as well, Commander. <br>
SHELBY: Of course. I appreciate any assistance you can offer. Tell me,
Commander. Is serving aboard the Enterprise as extraordinary an
experience as I've heard? <br>
RIKER: Every bit. <br>
SHELBY: Good. Because I intend to convince Captain Picard I'm the right
choice for the job. <br>
RIKER: Job? Which job? <br>
SHELBY: Yours, of course. I'm sorry. I heard that you were leaving. <br>

evidence of avifaunal or crawling vermicular lifeforms on Jouret Four. <br>
LAFORGE: That's not what she meant, Data, but you're right. She erred. <br>
SHELBY: I'm sorry, but I woke up early and I saw that a weather system
was moving in it. It could have affected the soil readings. <br>
RIKER: So without any regard to the risk of coming down alone <br>
SHELBY: Really, Commander, if we ran into the Borg here, two extra
bodies wouldn't've made a hell of a difference, now would they? We had
three hours before the storm front hit, less than two hours now. Data
was available. I took him. We came. I don't see your problem. <br>
RIKER: My problem, Commander, is I expect to be notified before there's
a change in my orders. <br>
SHELBY: Noted for future reference. Do you wish to hear my report, sir?

Shelby? <br>

little too easily. Sometimes with risks. <br>

recruited as a first officer. <br>

you need me. Particularly now. <br>
PICARD: Indeed? Starfleet needs good captains, particularly now.
Reconsider your decision. <br>
RIKER: Are you telling me to leave, Captain? <br>
PICARD: I'm asking you to look at your career objectively. Will, you're
ready to work without a net. You're ready to take command. And, you
know, the Enterprise will go along just fine without you.

myself hard to get this far. I sacrificed a lot. I always said I wanted
my own command, and yet something's holding me back. Is it wrong for me
to want to stay? <br>
TROI: What do you think? <br>
RIKER: Maybe I'm just afraid of the big chair. <br>
TROI: I don't think so. <br>
RIKER: The Captain says Shelby reminds him of the way I used to be. And
he's right. She comes in here full of drive and ambition. Impatient,
taking risks. I look at her and I wonder whatever happened to those
things in me? I liked those things about me. I've lost something. <br>
TROI: You mean you're older, more experienced. A little more seasoned. <br>
RIKER: Seasoned. That's a horrible thing to say to a man. <br>
TROI: I don't think you've lost a thing, and I think you've gained more
than you realise. You're much more comfortable with yourself than you
used to be. <br>
RIKER: Maybe that's the problem. I'm too comfortable here. <br>

subspace field. A definite pattern at four point eight minute intervals
during your first confrontation with them. <br>
LAFORGE: Might indicate high output auxiliary generators kicking in. <br>
SHELBY: One theory is that their systems are decentralised with
redundant power sources located throughout the ship. <br>
DATA: That is a reasonable conclusion. Borg technology has given each
member of their society the ability to interface and function
collectively. It is likely they have constructed their ship with the
same philosophy. <br>
WESLEY: You knock out one generator and another takes over without
interruption. <br>
RIKER: What kind of damage would we have to do to shut them down? <br>
SHELBY: Projections suggest that a Borg ship like this one could
continue to function effectively even if seventy eight percent of it
was inoperable. <br>
WESLEY: And our best shot barely scratched the surface. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, from what I've seen, I can't believe any of these new
weapons systems can be ready in less than eighteen months, Commander. <br>
SHELBY: We've been projecting twenty four. <br>
RIKER: Is there anything we can do here to adapt to our current defence
systems? <br>
LAFORGE: We'll have to go through the specs again, but. I don't know.
My mind's turned to clay. <br>
WESLEY: Mine too. <br>
SHELBY: I think we should look at modifying the plasma phaser design. <br>
RIKER: Commander, I think we should call it a night. That's an order.
We'll reconvene at oh five hundred. <br>
SHELBY: Sir, if you'll allow me to continue with Mister Data, who does
not require rest. <br>
RIKER: You need rest, Commander. <br>

defence systems <br>

Take a closer look, Commander. Mister La Forge? <br>

no defence may be adequate against this enemy.

PICARD: Something of a tradition, Guinan. The Captain touring the ship
before a battle. <br>
GUINAN: Before a hopeless battle, if I remember the tradition
correctly. <br>
PICARD: Not necessarily. Nelson toured the HMS Victory before
Trafalgar. <br>
GUINAN: Yes, but Nelson never returned from Trafalgar, did he? <br>
PICARD: No, but the battle was won. <br>
GUINAN: Do you expect this battle to be won? <br>
PICARD: We may yet prevail. That's a conceit, but it's a healthy one. I
wonder if the Emperor Honorious, watching the Visigoths coming over the
seventh hill, truly realised that the Roman Empire was about to fall.
This is just another page in history, isn't it? Will this be the end of
our civilisation? Turn the page. <br>
GUINAN: This isn't the end. <br>
PICARD: You say that with remarkable assuredness. <br>
GUINAN: With experience. When the Borg destroyed my world, my people
scattered throughout the universe. We survived. As will humanity
survive. As long as there's a handful of you to keep the spirit alive,
you will prevail. Even if it takes a millennium. <br>
