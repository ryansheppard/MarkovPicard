Captain's log, stardate 41365.9. The Enterprise has been ordered to
Starbase 74, in orbit around Tarsas Three. A routine maintenance check
of all systems will be made, and certain upgrades completed, including
the holodeck, with which we've had problems. I anticipate a glowing
report. The ship has performed magnificently, beyond anyone's
expectations.

sophistication of this programming is remarkable. <br>

figures that fight and fictional characters with which we can interact,
but you, you're very different. You adapt. You spoke to me in French. <br>

QUINTEROS: You haven't time. <br>
STARBASE: This is Starbase 74. The Enterprise magnetic field is
regenerating. <br>
LAFORGE: Wait a minute. How is that possible? <br>
STARBASE: Unknown. <br>
TASHA: That changes nothing. The Captain and Commander Riker must be in

Minuet are staring into each other's eyes) <br>
MINUET: And the boy never found out? <br>
RIKER: Oh, yes, but not until later when he came back into the room
with his little sister. <br>
MINUET: I'll bet both of them were all smiles. <br>
RIKER: Yes, but by that time both of them had been found out. <br>
MINUET: You handled that in a very thoughtful way. You're very good
with people. Don't you agree, Jean-Luc? <br>
PICARD: She's so very different from the images we've experienced on
the holodeck, isn't she? She's more intuitive. <br>
RIKER: It's as though she's been plugged into my subconscious. She
already knows what I want her to say before I'm aware of it myself. <br>
PICARD: I suppose it's an understandable progression. Computers make
decisions based on inputs and we humans give off a multitude of subtle
signs that communicate our emotions. <br>
RIKER: It's uncanny. I could develop feelings for Minuet, exactly as I
would for any woman. <br>
PICARD: Doesn't love always begin that way? With the illusion being
more real than the woman? <br>
MINUET: Oh, Jean-Luc, spoken like a true Frenchman. <br>
PICARD: Well, I think I'll be leaving. <br>
MINUET: Oh, don't go. <br>

stay. <br>

goes to the arch controls) <br>

RIKER: Riker to Bridge. <br>
PICARD: Computer, explain Red Alert. <br>
COMPUTER: Initiated as a programmed response. The magnetic field
containing the antimatter had weakened. There was no fail-safe
available. <br>
PICARD: Why wasn't I notified? <br>

PICARD: Present condition? <br>
COMPUTER: The magnetic field is now restored. Containment is restored.
Propulsion is at maximum efficiency. <br>
PICARD: Locate Lieutenant Commander Data. <br>

RIKER: The Bynars. <br>
PICARD: Am I to understand the Bynars have stolen the Enterprise? <br>
COMPUTER: That information is not available. <br>
PICARD: It's the Bynars, and you're part of this. <br>
MINUET: Yes. <br>
RIKER: They made you the lure to keep me here. They programmed you
while I was relaxing. <br>
MINUET: Yes. When they saw your interest in me, they thought I could
distract you and keep you here. <br>
PICARD: That explains, Riker. What about me? <br>
MINUET: Your being here was just a fortunate happenstance. <br>
RIKER: Why do they want with me? <br>
PICARD: What do they want with the Enterprise? What's their purpose? <br>
MINUET: I'm not programmed to give you that information. <br>
PICARD: Come on, Number One. We've got to regain control of our ship.

PICARD: As to that, there's no option. <br>
RIKER: I know. It's a five minute countdown. <br>
PICARD: That's sufficient to get to the Bridge. Once there, either
we'll get control of the ship and shut off the auto-destruct, or we
won't. This vessel must not fall into hostile hands. <br>
RIKER: Then let's set it and get going. <br>

RIKER: We're in orbit around Bynaus. How are they? <br>
PICARD: They appear dead. Let's see if we can get some answers from
Bynaus. <br>
RIKER: Their main computer is off. All sensors reveal that all of the
equipment on the planet is inert. They can neither receive nor send any
messages. <br>
PICARD: What about all the people in that world who are totally
dependant on their computer? Are they still functioning? <br>
RIKER: They're probably like these Bynars here. Dying. What is this all
about? Why did they steal the ship and bring it here? What is their
purpose? <br>
PICARD: They went to an awful lot of trouble to clear computer space.
Let's see what they've stored. <br>
RIKER: Captain, it's enormous. Every byte of free space in the computer
has been filled. They must have made a core-dump from their world to
our computer. I can't get in. I wish they'd left a note. <br>

MINUET: A star in the Bynar system went supernova and they
miscalculated. The electromagnetic pulse from the explosion was going
to knock out their main computer. <br>
PICARD: So their only choice was to transfer all the stored information
and shut down until after it passed. And then reactivate their system
and transfer the information back to this main computer. <br>
RIKER: The Enterprise has the only mobile computer large enough to
handle all that information. <br>
PICARD: So what went wrong? Why are they dying? <br>
MINUET: The star went supernova before it was expected, and you were
late arriving at Starbase 74. <br>
PICARD: Why didn't they say something? Why didn't they just ask for
help? <br>
MINUET: I don't know. I don't have those answers. <br>
PICARD: Is there anything we can do? <br>
MINUET: Yes. Return the data stored on the Enterprise's computer back
to the one on Bynaus. <br>
RIKER: How can we do that? <br>
MINUET: You don't know? <br>
RIKER: Yes. If we had the file name. But we don't. Do you? <br>
MINUET: I don't know what you're talking about. <br>
PICARD: They wouldn't intentionally hide it or make it difficult for us
to find. It must be right in front of our faces. <br>
RIKER: We should call Starbase 74, and see if anyone can decipher this.

were trying to save. Help them, Will. Hurry. Please.
