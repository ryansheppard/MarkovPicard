Anthony Brevelle recording. Lieutenant Susanna Leijten in command. <br>
SUSANNA: You up and running, Brevelle? <br>
BREVELLE [OC]: Yes, Lieutenant. <br>
LAFORGE: I've checked buildings four and five. Just like all the
others. No phaser hits, no sign of a fight. It's like the entire
outpost just vanished. <br>
HICKMAN: Lieutenant Leijten, you'd better come see this. No footprints,
no vehicle tracks. The wind probably erased them. But look. <br>

SUSANNA: That's Hickman on the right, Mendez on the left, and as
already noted, the recording was made by Ensign Brevelle five years
ago. <br>
PICARD: Commander Leijten, you said that before Brevelle deserted
Starbase one one two last week, he'd been ill for several days. What
about Mendez? <br>
SUSANNA: Mendez was seen on the Aries an hour before she disappeared.
According to witnesses, she seemed completely normal. <br>
RIKER: And Hickman? <br>
SUSANNA: He just passed a routine physical on Alia Four with flying
colours. <br>
LAFORGE: No, wait, I know Paul Hickman. He's a family man, he's got two
kids. He wouldn't steal a shuttle and desert. <br>
SUSANNA: Geordi, he was spotted by a Federation supply ship yesterday,
on course to Tarchannen three. <br>
PICARD: The original Tarchannen disappearances were never solved, were
they? <br>
SUSANNA: No, we never learned what happened or why. Forty nine people
gone. <br>
RIKER: And five years later, the away team that was investigating their
disappearances have started to disappear themselves. <br>

he was so full of himself. <br>

down there, but I've got to know for sure. <br>

SUSANNA: I'm not going to stay locked up on this ship while the

PICARD: Your devotion to duty is admirable, Commander, but Doctor
Crusher is right. You will remain on the Enterprise until we know
whether or not this is connected to the disappearance of the others. <br>
SUSANNA: Captain. <br>
PICARD: We have completed our survey on the surface. Analysing that
data will keep us busy for a while. <br>
SUSANNA: Yes, sir. I understand. <br>

SUSANNA: Sure. Let's get going. <br>
(Geordi and Susanna leave) <br>
PICARD: What about La Forge? <br>
CRUSHER: I gave him a complete bioscan. The results say he's in perfect
shape. <br>

they disappeared.

this is to get back down there with a dozen away teams, fan out from

these alien skin cells. <br>
SUSANNA: Source? <br>
DATA: Undetermined. <br>
LAFORGE: Without something else to cross-reference, it would take us
weeks to try and identify them. <br>

that these footprints found near the shuttle were not made by any known
Tarchannen life form. <br>
SUSANNA: If we're pursuing a theory that somehow unknown aliens are
involved, I think I should tell you that we didn't find tracks like
that during the original investigation. <br>

have been obliterated prior to your arrival. Doctor Crusher and I will
begin to search the medical database in an attempt to match these with
some known life form.

should stay here, in Sickbay. <br>

compelled to go down to the planet like the others? <br>

can be sure that I don't leave the ship. What would you do, Captain?
Would you sit it out here in Sickbay or try to learn what it is that's
got you and maybe stop it? <br>

CRUSHER [OC]: The surgery was successful </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: But it's going to be a few more hours
before we know how her regenerative systems are responding. In the
meantime, we'd better get Commander La Forge down here. <br>
PICARD [OC]: Very well, Doctor, keep us informed. <br>
CRUSHER: Crusher to La Forge. Computer, locate Commander La Forge. <br>
COMPUTER: Commander La Forge is not on board the Enterprise. <br>
CRUSHER: Bridge, the Computer says Commander La Forge is no longer on
board. Is that correct?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: I am showing no transporter activity. <br>
WORF: All shuttles are secure. <br>
RIKER: Negative. There's no indication that he's left the ship. <br>
PICARD: Computer, what was the last known location of Commander La
Forge? <br>
COMPUTER: Holodeck three. <br>
(Riker and Worf leave) <br>
CRUSHER [OC]: Captain, if Geordi has transformed, he may be virtually a
chameleon. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: The skin develops mimetic capabilities. He
may still be on board, but undetectable to our sensors.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Worf, Riker and two security guards enter) <br>
WORF: You search the structure. I will take the perimeter. <br>
(Worf walks around the buildings and comes back with a uniform) <br>
WORF: Commander. <br>
RIKER: Geordi's uniform.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Transporter room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(the door opens, and a transparent blur rushes in) <br>
HEDRICK: Security. We have an intruder in transporter room six. Argh. <br>
(the blur operates the controls)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Captain, the security lockout on Transporter
room six has been broken. <br>
PICARD: Re-engage now. <br>
DATA: I cannot, sir. The transporter cycle has already begun.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 44668.1. Doctor Crusher's
research indicates that we have less than an hour before Commander La
Forge's transformation becomes irreversible. However, all attempts to
locate him on the surface have failed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: I do not read any life signs on the surface. <br>
PICARD: Our sensor array is useless. We must find some other way of
locating him. <br>
DATA: Captain, if we can get close enough to Geordi, we can read his
absorption spectrum with an ultraviolet light. <br>
RIKER: Can you modify an emergency beacon to operate on UV? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. <br>
PICARD: Make it so. Number One, as soon as Data is ready, I want you to
lead an away team. <br>
RIKER: Aye, sir. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: How long, Data? <br>
DATA: I must replace the emitter module and reconnect the power supply.
It will take approximately two minutes to complete the modification,
sir. <br>
HEDRICK [OC]: Hedrick to Commander Riker. <br>
RIKER: Go ahead. <br>
HEDRICK [OC]: I've been able to determine La Forge's transport
coordinates. He beamed down next to the Aries shuttle. <br>
RIKER: Acknowledged. He's on foot, couldn't have gotten too far. Let's
assume a radius of ten kilometres. <br>
WORF: That still leaves a search area of more than three hundred square
kilometres. <br>
RIKER: We've got to narrow that down. What's happening with the
enhanced sensor arrays? <br>
WORF: All scans are still negative. <br>
RIKER: We've got to find a way to track him. What about the
high-resolution EM scans? <br>
WORF: We are adjusting sensors to read Commander La Forge's absorption
spectrum, but it will take several hours. <br>
RIKER: Geordi doesn't have several hours. <br>
DATA: I have completed modifications, Commander. <br>
RIKER: Excellent. Doctor Crusher, meet us in Transporter room six
immediately.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: He's going to need a sedative. Give me ten
cc's of kayolane. <br>
SUSANNA: Doctor Crusher. <br>
(some blue veins on her but the skin is now pink and the face is human)
<br>
CRUSHER: Say, you look a lot better than you did an hour ago. <br>
SUSANNA: What did you do? <br>
CRUSHER: We've removed some kind of parasite from your thymus. <br>
SUSANNA: No, no, no. It's not a parasite, Doctor. It was their method
of reproduction, to plant a DNA strand in a living host that causes
metamorphosis. Geordi? He's gone? <br>
CRUSHER: Yes. <br>
SUSANNA: He's gone back to the planet? <br>
CRUSHER: Try to stay calm. <br>
SUSANNA: No, but we have to find him. <br>
CRUSHER: An away team is preparing to search for him. <br>
SUSANNA: You'll never be able to find him. I'm the only one who can.
</font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(the away team arrives and switches on their palm
beacons) <br>
SUSANNA: No, you must turn them off. The light frightens them. <br>
RIKER: What about the ultraviolet? <br>
SUSANNA: That's beyond their visual spectrum. They won't run away from
it. <br>
WORF: He could be several kilometres away by now. <br>
SUSANNA: No, he's here. They're all here. <br>
(they walk towards the rocks and bushes) <br>
SUSANNA: There. <br>
(Data shines the UV, and three blue-veined humanoids appear. Two run
straight away, one hesitates) <br>
CRUSHER: Geordi? <br>
SUSANNA: Geordi, stop! <br>
(the group give chase) <br>
SUSANNA: No, wait. <br>
(she and Data go on alone around the back of the buildings and find one
frightened creature) <br>
SUSANNA: Geordi? Geordi, my voice is familiar. Listen to it. You can
feel that we share this. You know I'm not a threat.
The others, Mendez, Brevelle, they don't exist as humans any more, but
a part of you still does. You're not one of them yet, Geordi. I can
help you if you'll just trust me. I know what's going on inside of you,
the war you're fighting with yourself. Your humanity slipping away. The
instinct to run, it's overpowering, but they know how to beat it now,
Geordi. Look at me! I've come back, Geordi. Let me take you back, too.
Just take my hand. Please. <br>
(slowly, tentatively, then rushing into her arms) <br>
CRUSHER: Crusher to Enterprise. Lock on to Commander Leitjen's signal.
Prepare to beam two directly to Sickbay. <br>
SUSANNA: We're going home, Geordi.

PICARD: Is there no hope for Brevelle or Mendez? <br>
SUSANNA: None. <br>
LAFORGE: Susanna. <br>
SUSANNA: I'm right here, Geordi, and so are Doctor Crusher and Captain
Picard. <br>
CRUSHER: Here's your visor, Geordi. <br>
LAFORGE: Lieutenant Commander La Forge reporting for duty, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Welcome back, Mister La Forge. <br>
CRUSHER: Geordi, this species, can you communicate with it? <br>
LAFORGE: No. They act on instinct alone. In another few minutes, I
wouldn't have responded to you, Susanna. <br>
PICARD: Then we will leave them be. I'll order warning beacons placed
in orbit and on the surface. Hopefully, no one else will have to go
through what you did. <br>
(Picard and Crusher leave) <br>
LAFORGE: You know, down there, I didn't know who you were, and yet
somehow I believed you, I trusted you. <br>
SUSANNA: Must've been because of all the good advice I used to give
you. <br>
LAFORGE: Thanks. </font> </p>
