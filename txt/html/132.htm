Captain's log, Stardate 42477.2. The Enterprise has been diverted to
the Ramatis star system. It seems that both sides of a bitter planetary
conflict have petitioned Starfleet to transport to their world a
mediator they have mutually selected. Our orders are transportation
only, no interference.

PICARD Come. Ah, Number One. Look at this. Ever since we left the Lima
Sierra system, I have been puzzling over how the third planet could
maintain such an orbit, when it is theoretically impossible. But
consider this. <br>
RIKER: There's no degeneration. <br>
PICARD: Exactly. <br>
RIKER: Why? <br>

explain what happened in that system. <br>

PICARD: Thank you, no. <br>

centuries and its one that I find quite harmonious. <br>

PICARD: Deaf? <br>
WOMAN: Born, and hope to die. <br>
PICARD: And the three of you speak for him? <br>
CHORUS: Yes. <br>
SCHOLAR: We serve as translators. We convey not only his thoughts, but
his emotional intent as well. I am the Scholar. I represent the
intellect, and speak in matters of judgement, philosophy, logic. Also,
I am the dreamer, the part that longs to see the beauty beyond the
truth which is always the first duty of art. I am the poet who <br>
ADONIS: Artists, they tend to ramble, neglect the moment. I am passion,
the libido. I am the anarchy of lust, the romantic and the lover. I am
also the warrior, the perfect line which never wavers. <br>

PICARD: What? <br>
SCHOLAR: Speak directly to me. <br>
PICARD: The uniqueness of this presentation provoked this inadvertent
breach in protocol. No insult was intended. <br>
SCHOLAR: Then none is perceived. <br>
PICARD: I'm curious about how this rare form of communication came
about. <br>
WOMAN: The gene for hearing is not present in my planet's ruling line. <br>
SCHOLAR: Not that unusual, indeed it is similar to the House of Hanover
of your planet Earth, all who had haemophilia. Or the leaders of
Fendaus Five, who were without limbs. <br>
WOMAN: Many of the galaxy's greatest contributors have been similarly
special. <br>
SCHOLAR: My Chorus is so attuned, they can hear my thoughts and
translate to you. It is a relationship which goes back for centuries.
Their ancestors provided the same service to my ancestors. <br>
TROI: Your method of communication is most elegant and quite beautiful.
<br>
ADONIS: It takes a fine mind to realise that, Counsellor Troi. <br>
TROI: This part of you doesn't speak very often. <br>
ADONIS: Only when the spirit moves me. <br>
PICARD: Riva, if you are ready, the situation at Solais Five is very
critical. We should not delay. <br>

WOMAN: And without it, can you see? <br>

WOMAN: Then your visor serves the same function as my Chorus, which
interprets my thoughts and translates them into sound? <br>
LAFORGE: Yes. <br>
SCHOLAR: And you don't resent it? <br>
LAFORGE: The visor or being blind? <br>
SCHOLAR: Either. <br>

provoking an emotional revelation. <br>

TROI: Exactly what are you feeling? <br>

together and compare experiences. <br>

PICARD: I'm sorry, Data. Begin the briefing. <br>
DATA: The factions on Solais Five are historical enemies. So many have
died that both societies are on the verge of extinction. <br>
SCHOLAR: Enough. Thank you, Captain, there is no need to continue. The
specific issues of the conflict have no relevance. <br>
RIKER: So none of the background which we have provided would be
helpful in understanding why they continue to fight? <br>
SCHOLAR: The portfolio will indicate that the conflict is over a piece
of land, or wealth, or some other tangible asset. But we both know that
is not the case. <br>
RIKER: They've been at war for so long, it has become personal. <br>
SCHOLAR: Exactly. The basis for peace must also be personal. This is an
historic confrontation, correct? <br>
DATA: The factions have been at war for fifteen centuries. <br>
SCHOLAR: What's changed? <br>
DATA: I do not know what you mean. <br>
SCHOLAR: They have been killing each other for a long time, now they
want to talk peace. So something about this situation has recently
changed. What's the new piece to the puzzle? <br>
PICARD: Data? <br>
DATA: Unknown, sir. <br>
RIKER: Perhaps they have run out of people to kill. In any case,
whatever the reason, peace is now preferred,
which should make your job easier. <br>
SCHOLAR: Well, if not easier, at least possible, for now they are
motivated. But it doesn't matter. I'll find something. I always have. <br>
PICARD: Always? <br>
SCHOLAR: To date, I have never failed. Now, unless there is something
else? <br>
PICARD: No. This is for your benefit. <br>

me. <br>

feels, to allow it to fill you. <br>

TROI: How do we communicate? I know you can read lips, but I need your
words. <br>

what's important. Yes, that's true. We both know how to express
important words, like dream. Being here with you. Yes, being here with

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Come. <br>
(Troi and Pulaski enter) <br>
PICARD: How's our mediator. <br>
TROI: The same. He's withdrawn. He's very frightened. All of his life
he's been in control, and now for the first time he doesn't have any
answers. The doctor gave him a complete medical examination. <br>
PULASKI: His condition is hereditary. His brain cannot receive auditory
information. So all the prosthetics and surgical techniques I can use
wouldn't work. <br>
TROI: I don't know what we can do to help him. <br>
PULASKI: I can't do anything. <br>
TROI: It's up to him, and he's stopped cooperating.<br>
PICARD: Counsellor, couldn't you? <br>
TROI: Confidence is faith in oneself. It can't easily be given by
another. <br>
PICARD: You're right, of course. (doorbell) Come. <br>
(Data enters) <br>
DATA: Captain, I have reviewed and stored five distinct signing
languages. Here is an example of the first. This is blue. This is a
blue ocean. This is a blue ocean at sunset. This is two people walking
along the beach by a blue ocean at sunset. This is two happy people in
love walking along the beach by a blue ocean at sunset. This is two
people <br>
PICARD: Enough. Let's talk to Riva.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(for Data, read as if Riva is talking) <br>
PICARD: Riva, Commander Data has learned your sign language. Talk to
us. <br>
DATA: It was my fault. I am responsible for their deaths. In my
arrogance I thought no one could possibly harm the great Riva. I am
such a fool. <br>
PICARD: You are not to blame. What happened appears to have been the
work of one
desperate man. It may not reflect the feelings of the others. <br>
DATA: They were more than my interpreters. They were also my friends.
They were a part of me. I did not realise how much a part until now. <br>
PICARD: We have been contacted by the factions on Solais. They want to
renew negotiations. <br>
DATA: I cannot. I will not. <br>
TROI: Don't turn away. You have a chance to make some good come out of
this tragedy. This could be the catalyst which binds them together. <br>
DATA: Someone else will have to speak with them, not me. Not after what
I allowed to happen/ How could I? <br>
PICARD: But Data can understand you. Use him. Let him explain your
words. <br>
DATA: When Data speaks for me, can you hear my anguish, my despair?
Data is a fine machine, but he cannot take the place of my chorus. It
took years to develop a communication. That cannot be easily replaced. <br>
TROI: The Solari need you. <br>
DATA: I cannot help them. Captain, please take me back to Ramatis. <br>
PICARD: That is regrettable. A lot more people are going to die. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Geordi is having a check-up on his implants) <br>
PULASKI: It's possible to install optical devices which look like
normal eyes, and would still give you about the same visual range as
the visor. <br>
LAFORGE: Done? You say almost. How much reduction? <br>
PULASKI: Twenty percent. There is another option. I can attempt to
regenerate your optic nerve, and, with the help of the replicator,
fashion normal eyes. You would see like everyone else. <br>
LAFORGE: Wait a minute. I was told that was impossible. <br>
PULASKI: I've done it twice, in situations somewhat similar to yours.
Geordi, it would eliminate the constant pain you are under. Why are you
hesitating? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, when I came to see you, it was to talk about modifying
this. And now you're saying it could be possible for me to have normal
vision? <br>
PULASKI: Yes. <br>
LAFORGE: I don't know. I'd be giving up a lot. <br>
PULASKI: There's something else you must know. This is a one shot. If
you decide to change your mind, there's no going back. And there are
risks. I can offer choices, not guarantees. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, this is a lot to think about. I'll get back to you,
Doctor. Thank you. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Troi and Data enter. Data speaks for Riva) <br>
TROI: The Captain is going to take you to Ramatis. But first, he's
given me permission to attempt to settle the conflict down on Solais.
Yes. We've come so far, and paid such a terrible price, I must try.
Help me. <br>
DATA: You would be better off without my help. <br>
TROI: I have never attempted anything like this before. When dealing
with two factions so diametrically opposed, so entrenched in their
positions, where do you start? <br>
DATA: You want to know if I had some special technique? <br>
TROI: I want to know anything you can tell me that could help. <br>
DATA: There is no trick. I had no magic. <br>
TROI: What about your Chorus? <br>
DATA: Yes, my Chorus was special. They allowed me to combine different
perceptions. <br>
TROI: So there was a trick. <br>
DATA: Not really. My technique was to look for some thing, no matter
how small, that was common to both groups, and then to begin a process
where one person or one group expresses themselves to each other. <br>
TROI: That's very hard to accomplish. <br>
DATA: Yes, but what is even more difficult is to get each side to
listen, really listen to each other, and to understand. <br>
TROI: This isn't going to be easy for me. <br>
DATA: You are very good with people. <br>
TROI: But what I do is different. <br>
DATA: The real secret is turning disadvantage to advantage. <br>
TROI: Why can't you do that? Why can't you turn your disadvantage into
an advantage? <br>
DATA: That is an interesting. It would give them something in common.
(to Troi) I do not understand, Counsellor. To what is he referring? <br>
(Riva kisses Troi on the cheek, and thanks Data) <br>
DATA: Thank you. Thank me? Ah! <br>
PICARD: I will have the Captain contact then down on the planet and
tell them to prepare for your return.

RIKER: All right, stay sharp. We may have to get out of there in a
hurry. Set phasers on stun. Energise.

RIKER: Engineering, this is Commander Riker. <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: Go ahead, sir. <br>
RIKER: You can beam the table and torches down now. <br>
DATA: Light the torches to let them know that I am back. <br>
RIKER: It may be quite a while before the emissaries arrive. They'll be
more cautious after the last incident. <br>
DATA: You may leave whenever you choose. I will send out a message when
I am ready to go. <br>
RIKER: Deanna, I don't understand what he's going to do. How can he
mediate without his interpreters? He won't even be able to talk to
them. <br>
TROI: Riva is going to teach them sign language. <br>
DATA: Yes, it is turning a disadvantage into an advantage. Learning
sign will be a part of their process of learning how to live together
in peace. <br>
TROI: While they are learning how to communicate with Riva, they'll be
learning how to communicate with each other. <br>
DATA: And that is the first and most important aspect of any
relationship. Counsellor, it took me only moments to learn sign
language. It will take them months. <br>
TROI: Time well spent. <br>
DATA: These people have been fighting all of their lives. They know
only hatred, suspicion, and fear. Even with my
Chorus, I could not have changed their attitudes in a day. We have a
chance. They want the talks to be successful. <br>
RIKER: I'm still not comfortable leaving you here alone. <br>
DATA: Thank you for your concern. I will be fine. (to Troi) And thank
you, for everything. <br>
RIKER: Enterprise, four to beam up. Good luck. <br>

wait.
