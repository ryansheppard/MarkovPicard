This is Premier Bhavani of Barzan. Counsellor Deanna Troi. <br>

BHAVANI: Hopefully, it will also produce a new era of prosperity for my
people. <br>
MENDOZA: We'll see to that. <br>
PICARD: You know Mister Mendoza, the Federation negotiator. <br>

LEYOR: Madame. <br>

TROI: Ship's Counsellor Deanna Troi. <br>
MENDOZA: My good friend, Ral, is the best hired gun in the business. <br>
TROI: Hired gun? <br>
RAL: My good friend Mendoza means that I'm a negotiator who serves a
variety of clients. On this particular occasion I represent the
Chrysalians. <br>
BHAVANI: I believe it's almost time, isn't it Captain? <br>
PICARD: Indeed. It will be visible directly ahead. <br>
MENDOZA: Is it always on time, Bhavani? <br>
BHAVANI: Always. We see it every two hundred and thirty three minutes.
Our scientists say it's due to radiation buildup in the
accretion disk. The visible burst is very brief. <br>
(a circular burst of light) <br>
BHAVANI: There it is, ladies and gentlemen, the first and only stable
wormhole known to exist. It's yours, for the right price. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BHAVANI: And as you all know, the environment on my
planet is completely inhospitable to most other life forms. So I'd like
to express my appreciation to you, Captain Picard, for hosting these
negotiations. The Barzan has been a society dependent on others for
generations. We want that to end. The appearance of this stable
wormhole in our space provides us with our first true natural resource.
We have neither the experience nor the technology to exploit it. But
you do. <br>
RIKER: Excuse me. There's a delegation of Ferengi who wishes to be
beamed aboard, sir. <br>
PICARD: Were you expecting the Ferengi, Premier? <br>
BHAVANI: No, but I do not wish to create ill will, Captain. If they are
interested in bidding, I have no objection. <br>
PICARD: Chief O'Brien, this is Captain Picard. Will you beam the
Ferengi directly to the Observation lounge? <br>
O'BRIEN [OC]: Aye, sir. <br>
(Three Ferengi arrive. One is holding a purple bag) <br>
GOSS: On behalf of all Ferengi, I protest. Why were we not invited to
these negotiations? <br>
BHAVANI: My apologies. We did not anticipate your interest. You're
welcome to join us. <br>
GOSS: My name is DaiMon Goss. These are my consuls, Kol and Doctor
Arridor. We'll need chairs. <br>
PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. I'm serving as
host for these proceedings. <br>
GOSS: Good, then see to it that we get chairs. <br>
PICARD: Let me explain. <br>
GOSS: Fine, fine, just have your Klingon servant get us some chairs. <br>
WORF: I am in charge of Security. <br>
GOSS: Then who gets the chairs? <br>
PICARD: DaiMon, due to the delicate nature of these negotiations, all
parties have agreed that one representative would suffice. Now I will
be happy to provide your consuls with accommodations and you may have
my chair. <br>
GOSS: Very well. <br>
PICARD: Premier. <br>

GOSS: We can handle all the pleasantries later. Now, let's get down to
business. <br>

Inconsequential. Besides there are much better things to negotiate on

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: The data from the Barzan's probe of the
wormhole are quite impressive, Captain. The wormhole delivered the
probe beyond the Denkiri Arm, in the Gamma Quadrant. <br>
PICARD: It would take nearly a century at warp nine to cover that
distance. <br>
DATA: The same distance could be achieved in a matter of seconds
through the wormhole. <br>
RIKER: Imagine the Ferengi collecting tolls if we lose to them. <br>
MENDOZA: I don't think the Ferengi are the greatest threat at the
table. With all of DaiMon Goss' bluster, they don't have the resources
the Barzans need. <br>
RIKER: I think that Devinoni is the one that we need to watch out for. <br>
MENDOZA: An accurate observation. How did you recognise that? <br>
RIKER: He was the most one in the group. <br>
MENDOZA: You must play poker, Commander. <br>
RIKER: Poker? Is that a game of some sort? <br>
PICARD: Commander Riker conducts masterclasses in poker. <br>
MENDOZA: Our skills are not dissimilar, Commander. <br>
PICARD: Mister Mendoza, if this lives up to its billing, it will be a
discovery of extraordinary value. But it is a big if. <br>
RIKER: A wormholes is there one moment, and then gone the next. A
stable wormhole is unheard of. <br>
MENDOZA: Are you saying this may not be what it seems? <br>
DATA: The Barzans do not have manned space travel, so they had to
resort to an automated probe. Its findings are limited. It cannot be
determined from these charts how stable the wormhole really is, or how
long it will remain intact. <br>
PICARD: The Federation could wind up buying a proverbial lemon. <br>
DATA: Proverbial lemon? <br>
PICARD: Later, Data. <br>
MENDOZA: And of course that means, once the contract is negotiated and
closed, we would be obliged to fulfill the terms. <br>
RIKER: We think we should take a look for ourselves. <br>
MENDOZA: I don't think Bhavani could object to that. <br>
RIKER: Geordi has continuous visual contact with the wormhole, Captain.
I think he's the logical choice. <br>
DATA: I would also like to volunteer, sir. <br>
PICARD: Nobody's going in there until we have done a full sensor
analysis. I want to do everything possible to determine that it's safe,
and when I am satisfied, then you, Data, and Commander La Forge will
enter the wormhole
tomorrow.

administrative requirements are beyond our abilities. <br>
RIKER: Leyor, the Federation would like to negotiate a trade agreement
in which we could acquire your planet's rich deposits of trillium 323
which we would add to our bid, Premier Bhavani. <br>
LEYOR: My apologies. We have already reached an agreement with the
Chrysalians. <br>
(Leyor leaves) <br>
RIKER: Mister Ral? You either had very good instincts, or foreknowledge
of the Caldonian withdrawal. <br>
RAL: Some people just don't wish to transact business with the
Federation, Commander. The Chrysalians hereby add the Caldonian
trillium 323 to its bid, Premier. </font></p>

TROI: Everyone was talking today about the way you absorbed the
Caldonian bid. <br>
RAL: Well, the opening was there. I took it <br>
TROI: Commander Riker didn't know how you managed it. <br>
RAL: Let me tell you something about Commander Riker. He's good. He's
the most dangerous man in the room to me. <br>
TROI: But he doesn't have an edge. Your edge. <br>
RAL: Our edge. You make it sound unethical. <br>
TROI: Isn't it? <br>
RAL: Deanna, it's just business. <br>
TROI: Why haven't you told anyone you're an empath? <br>
RAL: Because I find it makes people uncomfortable. <br>
TROI: I think you don't tell them so you can gain an advantage. <br>
RAL: Well, I gained an advantage by using it with you. You didn't seem
to mind that. Look, Deanna, the point of negotiating is to take
advantage. I don't know what the other side is offering, and they don't
know what I'm offering. So we dance around each other until somebody
wins. I never cry foul when I lose. <br>
TROI: But you're reading their emotional states, their inner selves,
and then using that to manipulate them. <br>
RAL: Well, people have been doing that for thousands of years, just by
listening carefully, by watching body language. I just happen to be
better at it. You do it. <br>
TROI: I do it to help my crew, not outmanoeuvre them. And I don't hide
that I'm an empath. <br>
RAL: Oh, so you announce it to every alien culture you encounter? Or do
you use it to give your side an advantage. Do you tell the Romulan
that's about to attack that you sense that he may be bluffing? Or do
you just tell it to your Captain? <br>
TROI: That's different. That's a matter of protection. <br>
RAL: Yes, protection. Your protection, your Captain, your crew, your
edge. Yes. Now it's a matter of life and death when you take the
advantage.
Me, I deal in property. Exchanges. No body gets hurt. So you tell me,
which one of us would you say has more of a problem with ethics? Excuse
me. </font></p>

RIKER: Bought out the Ferengi yet, Ral? <br>
RAL: Think I should give it a try? <br>
RIKER: No, but I think that you will. One way or another, it's going to
come down to you and me. <br>
RAL: You know, you're very good at this. Very good. Much better than
you realise. <br>
RIKER: I hope I'm better than you realise. <br>
RAL: The last mile of the marathon is always the toughest. That's when
the winners are willing to take the big risks. Are you willing to do
that? <br>
RIKER: We'll see, won't we? <br>
RAL: Well, let's see now. I'm prepared to reach a firm agreement with
Bhavani before we learn the outcome of your probe's expedition. Are
you? Well, well, well. That would not be looked upon favourably by the
Federation, I'd imagine. See, you have to be willing to
take that last step alone or it just isn't worth playing. <br>
RIKER: Your point of view, not mine. <br>
RAL: Oh, I see that, Commander, I see that. Otherwise you wouldn't be
second in command of this starship. You know, I feel responsible for
you in a way. Related. Deanna. We both love Deanna. Oh, in different
ways, of course. <br>
RIKER: I will remove the burden of that responsibility right now. My
relationship with Deanna stands very well on its own without any help
from you. <br>
RAL: Of course it does. Of course it does. It's just that, well, she's
an extraordinary woman. Brilliant. Lovely. Very passionate. And she
could have been yours, Will, but you just didn't do enough to keep her.
And now, well, I'm here, and I'm going to take her too. <br>
RIKER: That's the first bad play I've seen you make. If you can bring
happiness into Deanna's life, nothing would please me more. You know,
you're really not such a bad sort, Ral, except you don't have any
values, beyond the value of today's bid, that is. Deanna is just the
woman to bring some meaning to your sorry existence, if you're smart
enough to take it. I doubt that you are. To the last mile. <br>

empathic powers which he uses to manipulate his competitors in a
negotiation. And yes, it did put me in a conflict of interest, which I
hope I have now resolved. Premier, I believe Ral has used your fear of
continuing aggression between the Federation and its enemies to
undermine our position. I also believe that this incident was staged by
Ral and Goss to provide you a reason to choose in favour of the
Chrysalians. <br>
