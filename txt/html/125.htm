back to the girl, right? Well, she smiles, looks him right in the eye
and says 'just try that in hyperspace!' <br>
(Geordi laughs) <br>
DATA: I see. So the difficulty in attaining such complex positioning in
zero gravity environment, coupled with the adverse effect it would have
on the psychological well being of the average human male, is what
makes this anecdote so amusing. Yes. Very humorous indeed. Hysterical,
in fact. <br>
(Data attempts to imitate a laugh. It is very forced) <br>
RIKER: What is our e.t.a. at Pacifica, Mister La Forge? <br>
LAFORGE: Twenty two hours fourteen minutes, sir. <br>
RIKER: Increase to warp six. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye sir. Full impulse. <br>
RIKER: Do you think anyone would object to our arriving ahead of
schedule? <br>
TROI: I know I won't. I've been really looking forward to a nice swim. <br>
DATA: You are aware, Counsellor, that the holodeck can be programmed to
recreate an oceanic environment. <br>
TROI: Data, it's just not the same. Have you ever been for a real
moonlight swim? <br>
DATA: One can swim in moonlight? <br>
TROI: How about you, Mister Worf? <br>
WORF: Swimming is too much like bathing. <br>
DATA: Commander Riker. I am receiving a Code Forty Seven. <br>
RIKER: Verify. <br>

PICARD: Yes, Number One. What is it? <br>
RIKER [on monitor]: An incoming message. Code Forty Seven, sir. <br>
PICARD: Pipe it through. <br>
COMPUTER: This is an emergency communiqué. It is not to be discussed
with fellow officers unless deemed absolutely necessary. There will be
no computer record of said transmission. <br>
PICARD: Understood. <br>
COMPUTER: Proceed with voice print identification. <br>
PICARD: Picard, Jean-Luc. Captain, USS Enterprise. <br>
COMPUTER: Voice print verified. <br>
PICARD: Walker! <br>
KEEL [on monitor]: Hello, Jean-Luc. It's been a long time. <br>
PICARD: Too long, old friend. Why are you contacting me on this
frequency? <br>
KEEL [on monitor]: It was a difficult decision. I felt it was worth the
risk. <br>
PICARD: Risk? <br>
KEEL [on monitor]: It's about Starfleet. About something we've always
considered to be impossible. <br>
PICARD: I don't understand. <br>
KEEL [on monitor]: I can't explain it now. We need to talk, face to
face. <br>
PICARD: You're using a Code Forty Seven. I have to know what this is
all about. <br>
KEEL [on monitor]: Not over subspace, no. <br>
PICARD: Oh, for God's sake, Walker. This is a secured channel <br>
KEEL [on monitor]: No. I want you to meet me on Dytallix B. <br>
PICARD: When? <br>
KEEL [on monitor]: Immediately. <br>
PICARD: Not possible. We're expected at Pacifica, <br>
KEEL [on monitor]: That can wait. You owe me. And you owe it to
yourself to hear what I have to say. Something is beginning. Don't
trust anyone. Remember that, Jean-Luc. Don't take anything for granted.
<br>
PICARD: Walker. <br>
KEEL [on monitor]: Dytallix B. We'll be waiting. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Data, are you familiar with Dytallix B? <br>
DATA: Dytallix B is one of seven uninhabited planets mined for the
Federation by the Dytallix Mining Company. It is in the nearby Mira
system. <br>
PICARD: Mister La Forge, chart a course for it immediately. Warp seven.
And there will be no records or logs mentioning any aspect of this
diversion. <br>
RIKER: Captain, they're expecting us at Pacifica. Shouldn't we contact
them and let them know. <br>
PICARD: Negative. Nothing goes out without specific orders from me.
Hopefully the delay will be minimal. <br>
(As the Enterprise rushes off on its new course, and Picard is in his
Ready room, Data is at a science station) <br>
DATA: I have the readout on Dytallix B, Commander. <br>
RIKER: What have you got? <br>
DATA: Dytallix B is the fifth of six planets circling the red giant
known as Mira. One side always faces the sun, where temperatures reach
up to one hundred and eighty degrees. The mines line the temperate zone
between the day and night sides, but they are long deserted. <br>
RIKER: Why the devil are we be going to this planet? Are there any
miners or indigenous life forms on the planet? <br>
DATA: I believe the answer to both questions is no, sir. In a manner of
speaking, it is nothing but a lifeless hunk of rock, a useless ball of
mud, a worthless chunk <br>
RIKER: Thank you, Data. I get the idea. Captain, we are approaching
Dytallix B. <br>
PICARD [OC]: Very good, Number One. I'm on my way. <br>
(Picard enters) <br>
WORF: Captain, sensors are detecting three Federation starships already
in orbit around the planet. <br>
PICARD: Identify. <br>
WORF: Two are frigates. The Renegade commanded by Tryla Scott, and the
Thomas Paine, Captain Rixx commanding. <br>
DATA: The third is just coming into range now, sir. It is Ambassador
Class heavy cruiser, USS Horatio. <br>
RIKER: Horatio? Isn't that Walker Keel's ship? <br>
WORF: Attempts at communication have been ignored by all three vessels.
<br>
PICARD: Make no further attempts, Mister Worf. Any life form readings
on the surface, Data? <br>
DATA: Three, sir. All gathered inside what appears to be the entrance
to a mining tunnel. <br>
PICARD: Very well. Relay those coordinates to the transporter room. I'm
beaming down. <br>

PICARD: Alone, Number One.

PICARD: This is some greeting, old friend. <br>
KEEL: Tell me, Jean-Luc, where did we first meet? <br>
RIXX: (the alleged Bolian) Answer the question. <br>
PICARD: Tau Ceti Three. It was a bar. Quite an exotic one as I
remember. What do I win? <br>
KEEL: Do you recall the night you introduced Jack Crusher to Beverly? <br>
PICARD: You know full well I hadn't even met Beverly then. You
introduced them. <br>
KEEL: My brother introduced them. <br>
PICARD: You don't have a brother. Two sisters, Anne and Melissa. What
the hell is this all about? <br>
(Keel nods, and weapons are put away) <br>
RIXX: Apologies, Captain. We had to make sure you were really you. <br>
PICARD: Walker, what is going on? <br>
KEEL: Captain Picard, meet Captain Rixx. <br>
PICARD: I believe we've met. The Altairian conference. <br>
KEEL: And Captain Scott. <br>
PICARD: Tryla Scott. It's said you made Captain faster than anyone in
Starfleet history, present company included. Are you that good? <br>
TRYLA: Yes, I am. <br>
PICARD: Starfleet's finest. Fancy meeting you here. <br>
RIXX: We all came secretly, Picard. To discuss the threat. <br>
PICARD: What threat? <br>
TRYLA: Have you noticed anything about Starfleet Command lately?
Anything unusual? <br>
PICARD: No. But we've been on the outer rim for a while. We haven't had
much contact with them. <br>
KEEL: Some of us have seen strange patterns emerging. Unusual orders.
High-ranking officials backing irrational proposals. <br>
RIXX: Starbase twelve was completely evacuated for two full days. No
explanation given. <br>
TRYLA: And what about the deaths? McKinney, Ryan Sipe, Onna
Karapleedeez. <br>
PICARD: All dead? <br>
TRYLA: A series of accidents. <br>
KEEL: Or so they say. It's hard to be certain of anything. Interfleet
communications are at a minimum. But something is happening. <br>
TRYLA: And we fully expect the Enterprise to be targeted soon. <br>
PICARD: Targeted for what? By whom? <br>
KEEL: We're not sure yet. Damn it, Jean-Luc. I tell you that some of
Starfleet's top command people are changing. This could affect the very
core of our organisation. Officers I've known for years are bluffing
their way through talk of old times. <br>
RIXX: That's their weakness, a lack of memory. <br>
TRYLA: He doesn't believe us. He thinks we're crazy. <br>
PICARD: You've given me nothing to believe in. Just a lot of vague talk
about strange patterns, irrational proposals. Who's behind this, and to
what purpose? How are people being changed? <br>
KEEL: I can't say exactly, but I think its spread to my own ship. My
First Officer hasn't been the same since we stopped off at Earth. Our
Medical Officer says he's perfectly normal, but I don't think I trust
him either. <br>
PICARD: Walker! <br>
TRYLA: We know we don't have all the answers. All we ask is that you
keep your eyes open. <br>
PICARD: That's sound advice at any time, Captain. <br>
KEEL: Stay in touch with us, covertly. This meeting never took place as
far as Starfleet is concerned. Please, I'm asking this as a personal
favour. I'm glad, Jean-Luc. I'm glad you're still one of us. Tell
Beverly I said hello. <br>
RIXX: And watch your back, Picard.

between. Two of the oldest and closest are Jack Crusher, may he rest in
peace, and Walker Keel. Before various missions split us apart, we were
virtually inseparable. I trust Keel completely. If he felt it necessary
to violate regulations, he must have had a good reason. <br>
TROI: But you're putting your career at risk for him. <br>
PICARD: Friendship must dare to risk, Counsellor, or it's not
friendship. <br>
TROI: They illicitly used the emergency channel to draw you here. Then
they asked you to keep secrets from your superiors. Effectively, to
disobey Starfleet regulations. <br>
PICARD: The people involved in this are of the highest calibre. If I
didn't believe in their loyalty, I wouldn't have gone this far. <br>

DATA: These are various outposts and starbases where I have detected
unusual activity over the past few months. <br>

areas. The new officers have had frequent contact with the highest
levels of Starfleet Command. <br>
RIKER: Why hasn't anybody discovered this before? <br>

Starfleet's left hand did not know what its right hand was doing. <br>

QUINN: Quite ready, Commander. <br>
RIKER: What's in the case? <br>
QUINN: Actually, I brought it for Doctor Crusher. But perhaps you would
like you to see it first? <br>
RIKER: What is it? <br>
QUINN: A form of life. It was discovered accidentally by a survey team
on an uncharted planet. <br>
RIKER: Why haven't we heard anything about that? <br>
QUINN: Oh, you'll be hearing about it shortly, but first there remains
much scientific study to be done. After all, it is a superior form of
life. <br>
RIKER: Superior? <br>
QUINN: Totally. Come, have a look. <br>
RIKER: I think I'll summon my Science Officer. <br>
(Quinn grabs his arm with a surprising amount of strength) <br>
QUINN: It won't like your Science Officer. It does like you! Vitamins.
They do wonders for the body. <br>
(There's a very one-sided fight - Quinn easily throws Riker around the
room)&nbsp;<br>
RIKER: Riker to Security. Guest quarters seventeen. Emergency. <br>

for your Riker. Then you can tell us about what's brought you here. <br>
PICARD: I see you keep up with our duty roster. <br>
AARON: Yes, of course, Captain. The Enterprise is very important to us.
<br>
REMMICK: Excuse me, gentlemen. <br>
(Remmick leaves) <br>
AARON: To the Horatio, gentlemen. <br>
SAVAR: The Horatio. <br>
(Picard does not drink) <br>
AARON: What an awful tragedy. Such a terrible loss of life. <br>
PICARD: It's interesting that you should mention the Horatio. It's one
of the subjects I wanted to discuss. <br>
AARON: Really? <br>
PICARD: Has the cause of her destruction been ascertained? <br>
SAVAR: Absolutely. Implosion, due to extreme negligence on the part of
her Captain. <br>
AARON: Enjoy, Picard. I believe you'll find it an excellent aperitif.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Worf and La Forge rush in) <br>
QUINN: It's good thing you're here. He slipped and hit his head. <br>
LAFORGE: This is Lieutenant La Forge in guest quarter seventeen. We
have a medical emergency. <br>
QUINN: Your Doctor Crusher is most capable. I'm sure he'll be all
right. Now if you'll excuse me, my time here is most limited. <br>
LAFORGE: Admiral. Don't you think we should wait until the Doctor gets
here? <br>
(Quinn throws him through the plywood doors into the corridor) <br>
QUINN: Now, Klingon, it's between you and me. <br>
(Worf's double handed blows have no effect. Quinn floors him easily) <br>
QUINN: Do Klingons fear death as much as humans? I could snap your neck
in a second, but it wouldn't be as much fun. <br>
(Three sustained bursts from Beverly's phaser finally put Quinn down) <br>
WORF: Are you all right? <br>
LAFORGE: If I could see, I'd be seeing stars. <br>
WORF: What is he? <br>
CRUSHER: Let's find out.

is Quinn. <br>
LAFORGE: How can that be? The man picked me up like a rag doll. <br>
CRUSHER: I'm going to have to do a complete internal scan. <br>
LAFORGE: Keep me posted, Doctor, I'll be on the Bridge. <br>

CRUSHER: What is that? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AARON: What do you know of conspiracies, Captain? <br>
PICARD: Not nearly enough, I suppose. <br>
AARON: That's the charming thing about them, isn't it? When a
machination is real, no one knows about it. And when it's suspected,
it's almost never real. <br>
SAVAR: Except, of course, in paranoid delusions for those who believe. <br>
REMMICK: Sorry to interrupt. Dinner is served. <br>
AARON: Wonderful. Bantering with the Captain has given me quite an
appetite. <br>
PICARD: I need to contact my ship to let Commander Riker that we're
about to sit down. <br>
SAVAR: Of course, Captain. We'll wait for you at the table. <br>

a circle. There is a covered bowl in front of each person) <br>
AARON: Please, sit down, Captain. We've been waiting. Go ahead and
start, Captain. We don't stand on ceremony here. <br>
(The bowl contains live mealworms. Picard recoils) <br>
AARON: Oh do eat up, Picard. Raise your hand if you want seconds. <br>
(Picard gets up and starts to back out of the room) <br>
PICARD: Riker! Thank God. We're leaving. <br>
RIKER: You're not going anywhere. You'll be one of us soon. <br>
AARON: You were meant for the Doctor. <br>
RIKER: It couldn't be helped. Riker walked in on us unexpectedly. <br>

SAVAR: No matter. The Doctor will soon be joining us. All in good time.

(Tryla Scott enters) <br>
SAVAR: Well, Captain Scott. Good. Now the setting is complete. <br>
AARON: You don't really think we were in the dark about your
intentions, do you? <br>
SAVAR: Patience is one of our virtues, Captain. We didn't go after you,
we allowed you to come after us. <br>
AARON: More dramatic that way, don't you think? <br>
TRYLA: Yes, the one thing both races share is a love of theatre. And
you've put on a fine show. <br>
PICARD: What race are you? Where are you from? <br>
SAVAR: It's not important. Let us just say we've come a long way to
join you. <br>
TRYLA: It's a perfect match. We're the brains, you're the brawn. <br>
RIKER: You'll understand soon, Picard. <br>
SAVAR: Indeed. We've been moving slowly, cautiously, for many months
now. Careful to cover our tracks. Careful not to arouse suspicion,
until it's too late. <br>
RIKER: And now it's too late. For you, that is. <br>
AARON: Well said, brother. Picard and Riker control the Enterprise,
which means we control the Enterprise. <br>
SAVAR: Eat hearty, brother! Relish your new body! <br>
(Riker takes a handful of mealworms, and is about to eat them when
instead he draws his phaser and shoots the other person sitting
opposite. Picard disarms Tryla Scott so Riker can shoot her, Aaron runs
out, the parasite leaves Tryla and Savar neck-pinches Riker. Picard
shoots Savar before Riker passes out) <br>
