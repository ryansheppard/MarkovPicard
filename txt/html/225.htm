PICARD: Magnify. Mister Data? <br>
DATA: It appears to be a probe of some kind, but there is no Starfleet
record of this shape or design. <br>
RIKER: Is it scanning us? <br>
WORF: No sir, but it has assumed a relative position and it is holding
course with us. <br>
DATA: The probe is composed of paricium and talgonite, a ceramic alloy.
<br>
LAFORGE: Not a very sophisticated technology. <br>
WORF: Sir, I am detecting a low-level nucleonic beam coming from the
probe. <br>
RIKER: Shields up. Stand by phasers. <br>

emitting an unusual particle stream. <br>

PICARD: Ah. Batai. And you say I've been ill? <br>
BATAI: For more than a week. Eline should've put you in the hospital,
but she insisted on caring for you herself. <br>

everywhere. Why did you worry us like that? Are you hungry? <br>
PICARD: Hungry, thirsty, exhausted. I suppose that proves this is not a
dream, doesn't it? <br>
ELINE: You think this, your life, is a dream? <br>
PICARD: This is not my life. I know that much. <br>

ELINE: You always say that. <br>
PICARD: Would you try to answer some questions for me, no matter how
strange they may seem to you? <br>
ELINE: Of course. <br>
PICARD: Are there other planets in this star system? Do you visit other
systems? All right. Do you have a communication system here? How do you
send messages to other communities, to other places? <br>
ELINE: The usual way, by voice-transit conductor. Do you want to send a
message? <br>
PICARD: Yes. When can that be arranged? <br>
ELINE: Tomorrow. Don't you want to ask about us? <br>
PICARD: Of course. Anything you can tell me will be helpful. We're, er,
um, married? <br>
ELINE: Three years ago. The happiest day of my life was the day we got
married. <br>
PICARD: And what do I do here in Ressik? <br>
ELINE: You're the best iron weaver in the community. At least I think
so. You prefer playing the flute, of course. <br>
PICARD: The flute? <br>
ELINE: Yes. <br>
(she fetches him a penny whistle decorated with a tassel) <br>
PICARD: And when did I learn to play it? <br>
ELINE: I'm afraid you never did, dear, but you keep trying. <br>
(he gives it a trial blow) <br>
PICARD: I see what you mean. Well, thank you for the soup. Thank you
for your help. Tomorrow, will you help me send a message? <br>
ELINE: Of course. Will you come to bed? <br>
PICARD: Oh, I'll sleep here. <br>

fair to you. <br>

block it. <br>

that ship of yours is. How to get back to that life. <br>
PICARD: The memory is five years old now, but it's still inside me. <br>
ELINE: Was your life there so much better than this? So much more
gratifying, so much more fulfilling, that you cling to it with such
stubbornness? <br>
PICARD: Eline. <br>
ELINE: It must have been extraordinary. But never in all of the stories
you've told me have you mentioned anyone who loved you as I do. <br>
PICARD: It was real. It was as real as this is. And you can't expect me
to forget a lifetime spent there. <br>
ELINE: Yes, I can. I've been patient, Kamin. For five years I've shared
you with that other life. I've listened, I've tried to understand, and
I have waited. When do I get you back? <br>
PICARD: I know. I know. It has been hard on you. <br>

can explain to me, when crops are dying all over, how this tree is
flourishing? <br>
BATAI: This tree is our symbol, our affirmation of life. Everyone in
this town gives part of their water rations to keep it alive. We've
learned, Administrator, that hope is a powerful weapon against
anything. Even drought. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: A good point. Perhaps I shall recommend a symbolic tree
in each of my communities. Now. What business do we have today? <br>
BATAI: We need help if we're to increase the water supply. We think
there are ways to reclaim some of our water. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Batai, you're being a bit of an alarmist. True, we are
in a drought, but water rationing has produced a sizeable savings. <br>
PICARD: If the weather pattern doesn't change, rationing will not be
enough. We'll run out of water. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Who is this? <br>
BATAI: Kamin, sir. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Kamin. Do I know you? <br>
PICARD: No. I haven't spoken to you before. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Well, Kamin, I'm open to all the people of this town.
I'm delighted to hear what you have to say. <br>
PICARD: I suggest that we build atmospheric condensers which could
extract water from the air. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: I don't mean to quash your very creative ideas but
building atmospheric condensers would be a monumental undertaking. We
could not hope to sustain such a project. <br>
PICARD: Each community would be responsible for its own. Condensers
could make the difference between watering our crops or watching them
die. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Well, I'll be glad to pass along your idea. You'll see
that this kind of participatory government works for everyone. Be well,
Batai. I shall see you next month. Good to meet you, Kanin. <br>
BATAI: Go carefully, Administrator. <br>
(The Administrator leaves) <br>
BATAI: That went very well. I think he was impressed with you. <br>

BATAI: These things take time, but it will happen. I'm sure of it. <br>
PICARD: Come and have supper tonight, my friend. I'll make some
vegetable stew. Let's talk about building our own condenser. <br>

for the first time in years, you were speaking as though you were truly
a member of the community. It was good to hear that again.

think it came from the propulsion system. Looks like it used a solid
propellant as fuel. <br>
RIKER: Solid propellant? <br>
LAFORGE: Sensors read this stuff as crystalline emiristol. It produces
a radioactive trail that ought to be traceable. <br>
RIKER: Then we should be able to send out a probe of our own, trace it
back to the origin. <br>
LAFORGE: I'll get right on it. <br>
DATA: Commander, I have been analysing the nucleonic beam. I believe it
would be possible to reflect the particles back toward the probe in a
way that would disrupt the signal. <br>

out right away. It might do more harm than leaving it there. <br>

PICARD: If you won't take them, I most certainly will. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Your observations, your findings, our scientists reached
those same conclusions two years ago. Well, what did you expect us to
do? Make it public? Can you imagine the effect? <br>
PICARD: But surely the technology must exist to save something of this
world? Perhaps some people could be evacuated. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Evacuated where? Our technology is limited. We're just
beginning to launch small missiles. <br>
PICARD: A collection of genetic samples, then. Something, anything. You
simply cannot let this civilisation die. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Enough! There is a plan in work. I cannot tell you more
than that. <br>
BATAI JR: Father! <br>
PICARD: What is it? <br>
BATAI JR: It's Mother. Hurry.

DOCTOR: Kamin. I'm sorry. <br>
ELINE: You see? I go to any lengths to get your attention. <br>
PICARD: You always did have a flair for the dramatic. <br>
ELINE: Doctor, thank you. (Doctor leaves) Batai, leave us alone for a
moment. I need to talk to my husband. <br>
(Batai leaves) <br>
ELINE: Did you show the Administrator your evidence? <br>
PICARD: I didn't have to. They already knew. <br>
ELINE: So, he won't throw you off the Council? <br>
PICARD: No. <br>
ELINE: Good. Remember, put your shoes away. <br>
PICARD: I promise. <br>

floor) <br>
PICARD: Gotcha! Now I gotcha. <br>
MERIBOR: Some children are certainly making a lot of noise in here. <br>
PICARD: You shouldn't be outside so long. It's damaging, you know that.
<br>
MERIBOR: I'm wearing plenty of your skin protector. <br>
PICARD: How about you, young man? Do you wear your skin protector
outdoors? You do? Good boy. <br>
BATAI JR: (now with his father's hairline) Happy day, everybody. It's
time to go see the launching. <br>
PICARD: What launching? What's he talking about? <br>
MERIBOR: They're sending up a missile, Father. We're going to watch it.
<br>
PICARD: I'm not going anywhere to watch anything. <br>
BATAI JR: Come on, Kamie. Hurry up now. Let's go see the launching. <br>
(Batai puts a hat on his nephew and they leave) <br>
PICARD: It breaks my heart to look at him. <br>
MERIBOR: Who? <br>
PICARD: My grandson. It breaks my heart. He deserves a rich, full life,
and he's not going to get one. <br>
MERIBOR: Please come, Father. <br>
PICARD: Why didn't I hear anything about a launching?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(everyone is in broad rimmed sunhats and loose
clothing) <br>
PICARD: Did everyone know about this except me? I'll be all right
sitting here. You go off with the others. Hold onto my grandson, and
watch the damned thing go up for all the good it'll do. What is it
they're launching? <br>
MERIBOR: You know about it, Father. You've already seen it. <br>
PICARD: Seen it? What are you talking about? I haven't seen any
missile. <br>
BATAI: Yes, you have, old friend. Don't you remember? <br>
PICARD: Batai? <br>
(Batai as the healthy middle-aged man we first met) <br>
BATAI: You saw it just before you came here. We hoped our probe would
encounter someone in the future. Someone who could be a teacher.
Someone who could tell the others about us. <br>
PICARD: Oh, it's me, isn't it? I'm the someone. I'm the one it finds.
That's what this launching is. A probe that finds me in the future. <br>
ELINE: Yes, my love. <br>
PICARD: Eline. <br>
ELINE: The rest of us have been gone for a thousand years. If you
remember what we were, and how we lived, then we'll have found life
again. <br>
PICARD: Eline. <br>
(a rocket soars into the cloudless blue sky) <br>
ELINE: Now we live in you. Tell them of us, my darling.

DATA: The nucleonic beam has ceased, Commander. The probe has shut
down. <br>
CRUSHER: His cerebral functions are stabilising. <br>
RIKER: Mister Worf, put a tractor beam on that probe. I want it in
shuttlebay two for examination. <br>
WORF: Yes, Commander. <br>
PICARD: What? <br>
CRUSHER: Please, Captain, don't get up too quickly. <br>
PICARD: Captain? This is the Enterprise. I'm Jean-Luc Picard. How long?
<br>
RIKER: Twenty, twenty five minutes. <br>
PICARD: Twenty five minutes? <br>
CRUSHER: Captain, I want you in Sickbay. I'd like to run a full
diagnostic on you. <br>
PICARD: Doctor Crusher. <br>

PICARD: Come. <br>
RIKER: Hello, sir. Feeling better? <br>
PICARD: Yes. Yes, thank you. But I find I'm having to rediscover that
this is really my home. <br>
RIKER: We were able to open the probe and examine it. Apparently,
whatever had locked onto you must have been self terminating. It's not
functioning any longer. We found this inside. <br>

tassel. Picard clutches it to his chest for a moment, then plays his
Skye Boat song variation on it) </font> </p>
