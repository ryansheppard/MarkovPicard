The years I'd spend on this mission, the distance it has taken me away
from home. As you must have heard, genetic bonding is a Betazoid
tradition. Steven Miller was my father's closest friend. <br>
RIKER: Your father was human, Deanna. The Millers are human <br>

somewhere. <br>
WYATT: I'd like you to have this. It's a Chameleon Rose. It changes

WYATT: Your mother is still down on the planet, Deanna. <br>
TROI: Why? <br>
WYATT: Er, is there a place for my parents to rest, Captain? <br>
STEVEN: Well, we're not really tired, son. Besides, I'd like to see
some of the ship. <br>
VICTORIA: Steven, you know full well Lwaxana Troi isn't about to beam
on aboard until we leave. So? <br>

TROI: Yes, he does. But I'm not what he expected. <br>
PICARD: I don't understand. <br>
TROI: Neither do I, but I'm definitely a surprise of some sort to him.
I should warn you, sir. My mother is a little eccentric. <br>

LWAXANA [OC]: Deanna, shame. What has this life done to you? <br>
LWAXANA: No, don't tell me. You're the Captain. <br>
PICARD: Of course. Your daughter has explained your telepathic ability.
<br>
LWAXANA: That wasn't telepathy, it was just common sense. Who else
would they send to greet me but the Captain? You may carry my luggage. <br>
TROI: Mother! <br>
PICARD: No, no, that's quite all right. I'm indebted to your mother for
the fine Counsellor she <br>

captain to <br>
LWAXANA: Yes, you do seem to be having difficulty. A man your age must
work to keep himself in shape. <br>
TROI: Mother, I'm not going another step like this. A starship has its
customs, just as we do. If you're my mother's valet, then please valet!
<br>
PICARD: Oh, please don't let me keep up from doing your duty. <br>
LWAXANA: I apologise for her behaviour. Do you realise you've
embarrassed your Captain? <br>
PICARD: Oh, no. <br>
LWAXANA: Anything to avoid a quarrel on this occasion. It's amazing how
that accent of yours reminds me of your father. <br>
(Mr. Homn the valet lifts the case with ease) <br>
TROI: Your last valet tried so hard to rid me of it. Whatever happened
to Mister Xelo? <br>
LWAXANA: I was forced to terminate his employment. Xelo was strongly
attracted to me. His thoughts became truly pornographic.

LWAXANA: Between him and that woman's inane chatter, it's a wonder I
made it here at all. How do you like the Millers, Captain? <br>
PICARD: I'm sure I find them perfectly pleasant <br>
LWAXANA: As for me, I find it shocking how they've changed in the years
since my husband and I knew them. Of course, it's probably because I've
grown beyond them. You realise of course that with Betazoids, our
ability to read the thoughts of others does see us grow much faster
than the typical plodding human who <br>

LWAXANA: Yes, the room is adequate. Small, but adequate. You will of
course adjust the temperature to a civilised level? <br>
PICARD: I'll see what I can do. And now, if you will excuse me, I'm
sure the two of you have a lot to talk about. <br>
LWAXANA: Yes, Captain. You may go. <br>
(Picard backs out of the room with a bow) <br>
LWAXANA [OC]: You've been slack, little one. Allowed your mental powers
to rust. <br>
TROI [OC]: Only to avoid confusion, mother. Humans constantly think one
thing and say another. <br>
LWAXANA [OC]: Yes, they do, don't they. Poor dears. Our style of
complete honesty frightens them. <br>
TROI: On that subject Mother, there is such a thing as too much honesty
with humans. <br>
LWAXANA [OC]: If they'd only say what they think instead of hiding it.
An entire shipload of such inconsistency could drive one insane. <br>
LWAXANA: Darling, I'm terribly sorry about what happened here. Truly I
am. Steven Miller tracked me down and reminded me of the vows we had
made. <br>
TROI: Mother, I'm having some trouble believing in those vows as once I
did. <br>
LWAXANA: Deanna. <br>

VALEDA [on viewscreen]: Your presence honours us, and your timing is
fortuitous, Captain. <br>

VALEDA [on viewscreen]: An incoming vessel has bypassed our stargate,
violating our law. It has refused any attempt at communication. <br>
PICARD: Are you saying you believe it to be hostile? <br>
VALEDA [on viewscreen]: Failure to communicate is inherently hostile.
We have no defensive capabilities here and our treaty with the
Federation specifies your obligations in that matter. <br>

WYATT: Your mother's honest. I respect that. <br>
TROI: Yes, but she never lets up. <br>
WYATT: I'll admit, her honesty is a bit persistent. <br>
TROI: I never heard it described better. But it is a Betazoid trait.
I'll try to be only half as annoying. <br>
WYATT: Let's see, what can I tell you about myself? I'm a medical
doctor, for whatever that's worth. <br>
TROI: Doctor? <br>
WYATT: If you're picking up my thoughts, you'd know. You can do that,
can't you? <br>

could read each other eventually. <br>
WYATT: Can I take that as a compliment? <br>
TROI: Absolutely. I only ever felt this, well, with someone who's on
this ship. <br>

TROI: No. What he wants most is to captain a starship. <br>
WYATT: What I want is to cure people. <br>

concert. We are going to be together a long time. <br>
WYATT: Yes. That is the point of marriage, I suppose. <br>

your mind very much on these. They are your work, aren't they? <br>
WYATT: I can see it'll be very hard to keep secrets from you. <br>
TROI: This is why you were surprised when you first saw me. This woman.
You thought that I would be this woman. <br>
WYATT: I have seen this face ever since I was a boy. When I closed my
eyes at night, I could hear her whispering my name. And knowing you
were Betazoid, I just assumed it was you projecting yourself into my
mind. <br>

You are so beautiful. I feel honoured. <br>

a custom of her home world which the facts of the twenty-fourth century

I could intervene.

these years to get here. <br>
PICARD: Go on with your briefing, Mister Data. <br>
DATA: Tarella was class M, much like your Earth, with similar humanoid
life forms.
Unfortunately they faced the old story of hatred out powering
intelligence. <br>
PICARD: There were hostilities? <br>
DATA: Between the inhabitants of their two land masses, resulting in
one group unleashing a deadly biological weapon on the other. <br>
CRUSHER: And in the end the other became infected as well. Makes one
question the sanity of humanoid forms. <br>
PICARD: Can you identify the origin of the infection, Doctor? <br>
CRUSHER: The Tarellians had reached Earth's late twentieth century
level of knowledge. That's all you need if you're a damned fool. A
deadly, infectious virus which at that modest level of knowledge is not
difficult to grow. <br>
TASHA: We learned the rest of the story in security training. Some
Tarellians made it to other worlds only to die along with the
populations they infected. <br>
LAFORGE: It's pretty well covered in Academy training now, Captain.
Many of them tried to avoid other civilised worlds as they escaped only
to be hunted down and destroyed anyway. <br>
PICARD: And it was believed that the last Tarellian vessel was
destroyed eight years ago by the Alcyones. <br>
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. <br>
PICARD: Exactly when will they reach Haven? <br>
DATA: Exactly thirteen hours, nine minutes, twenty two seconds, three
hundred fifty <br>
PICARD: Thank you. Which creates a very difficult problem for the
Enterprise. Our treaty requires us to protect Haven, and Federation
policy requires that we assist life forms in need, which must include
the Tarellians. I'll want you to help me find some answers. Thank you.

LWAXANA: All parties do not request it. It's simply out of the
question. I'm sorry, Captain, but unfortunately you are not practiced

Haven? <br>

during the following conversation and gets on everyone's nerves) <br>
PICARD: Yes, it is true. <br>
WYATT: That's amazing. I've read everything I could about them.
Biological virus analysis was a favourite subject at medical school. <br>
CRUSHER: In which case I'd very much like to confer with you. I'm
pleased to have a medical colleague aboard. <br>
WYATT: Yes, ma'am, Doctor. Would it be possible to prepare some medical
needs, geared toward the Tarellian's probable needs? We could beam it
over without any fear of infection. <br>
PICARD: What do you think, Doctor? <br>
CRUSHER: It's a very considerate idea. Our Sickbay is at your disposal,
Doctor. <br>

the food we eat. <br>

course screams) <br>

widely regarded as the most beautiful in the universe. After the young
couple have removed their clothing <br>

LWAXANA: All guests must go unclothed. It honours the act of love being

bad. Besides, your husband quite likes the idea of seeing me unclothed.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: How can you be certain they're receiving
us? <br>
DATA: Because our sensors are showing a responder echo, sir, on the
frequency they once used. <br>
LAFORGE: We have a message, sir, coming in from Haven. <br>
PICARD: On viewer. <br>
VALEDA [on viewscreen]: Captain, the plague ship is approaching
transport range. <br>
PICARD: We are aware of that, Electorine. <br>
VALEDA [on viewscreen]: Do you realise that they can turn this lovely
world of ours into a graveyard? Please, please take action now before
it's too late. <br>
RIKER: We recognise your situation. <br>
VALEDA [on viewscreen]: Please destroy them now! <br>
PICARD: We will not fire on them, Electorine. <br>
VALEDA [on viewscreen]: You must! <br>
(transmission ends) <br>
TASHA: I'm certain I could disable their ship with a phaser burst,
Captain. <br>
PICARD: And then, Lieutenant? <br>
DATA: They're within transporter range, sir. <br>
PICARD: Then we can't delay any longer. Ready the tractor beam,
Lieutenant Yar. Target the ship. Activate on my command. <br>
TASHA: Tractor beam ready. <br>
PICARD: Engage. <br>
TASHA: Got them, sir. <br>
PICARD: Do we have them securely, Lieutenant? Can they beam out to the
planet? <br>
TASHA: Negative, sir. They can't leave that ship. <br>
LAFORGE: I know they can receive us, Captain. At this distance they can
respond with running lights if necessary. <br>
DATA: Unless they have all died. Their ship could have been brought in
by automation. <br>
RIKER: Captain! <br>

receiving us? <br>
(A balding man moves the young woman aside) <br>
WRENN [on viewscreen]: My name is Wrenn, and before I enquire why your
tractor beam has trapped us here, is there one aboard your vessel named
Wyatt? <br>
(Crusher and Wyatt enter. He has his drawings with him) <br>
WYATT: Captain, I don't understand. <br>
WRENN [on viewscreen]: It's astounding. Ariana was right. He is here,
daughter. <br>
ARIANA: Wyatt, you've come just as you promised. <br>
WYATT: How could I be so accurate? Except for the dream images, I've
never seen her. <br>
PICARD: Sir, our concern is with the threat your vessel poses to the
planet below. If you're still carrying the infection which destroyed
your world <br>
WRENN [on viewscreen]: Oh, we still carry it, Captain. My daughter, I,
all eight of us. <br>
PICARD: Eight? <br>
WRENN [on viewscreen]: All of us that are left, Captain. Most of the
rest passed on during the years that it took to reach Haven. <br>
PICARD: If you've come here because of the legend about planet Haven
miraculously healing the sick. <br>
WRENN [on viewscreen]: We don't ask to make contact with those living
below. All we ask is to be on the edge of some sea,
some unpopulated island, a faraway peninsula. <br>
PICARD: This is not our planet, sir, but I will present your needs to
those who do govern this world. <br>
WRENN [on viewscreen]: Present the fact we intend to die here, Captain.
And if we die while caged by your tractor beam, so be it.

hairstyle? Of course, it's going to look much better on me when I'm
naked. <br>
WYATT: Mrs. Troi, can I talk to you about something serious? <br>
LWAXANA: Oh, but I am always serious, dear boy. Only my pleasant nature
makes it appear otherwise. <br>
WYATT: Please, Mrs. Troi. <br>
LWAXANA: Yes, that was puzzling. A woman out of another place who
insists that she knows you. <br>
WYATT: And <br>
LWAXANA: And whom you've dreamed of all these years. <br>
WYATT: And I hoped that the way you handle thoughts <br>
LWAXANA: Fascinating, Wyatt, how easily your thoughts come through. The
answer to the puzzle of Ariana and you is so simple, it's too simple
for most humans to understand. <br>
WYATT: Too simple? <br>
LWAXANA: Of course. It's something they all know instinctively but go
to great effort to reject or to build complicated superstitions about.
All life, Wyatt, all consciousness, is indissolvably bound together.
Indeed, it's all part of the same thing. <br>
WYATT: Yes. I have wondered if something like that <br>
LWAXANA: That weren't so. And no doubt so has Ariana, which helped the
two of you to make contact. Wyatt, tell me something seriously. Which
of these would look best on me naked? </font></p>

too old. Perhaps I should choose you. <br>
