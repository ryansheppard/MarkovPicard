WORF: I am glad you approve. I have always found the Black Sea at night
to be a most stimulating experience. <br>
TROI: Worf, we were walking barefoot on the beach with balalaika music
in the air, ocean breeze washing over us, stars in the sky, a full moon
rising, and the most you can say is stimulating? <br>
WORF: It was very stimulating. <br>
(the turbolift arrives as Troi rolls her eyes) <br>
WORF: What? <br>
(exiting the turbolift into another corridor) <br>
TROI: You know, I don't spend nearly enough time on the holodeck. I
should take my own advice and go there to relax. Next time I'll choose
the programme. If you like the Black Sea, you're going to love Lake
Cataria on Betazed. <br>
WORF: Deanna, perhaps before there is a next time, we should discuss
Commander Riker. <br>
TROI: Why, is he coming along? <br>
WORF: No, but I do not wish. I mean, it would be unfortunate if he. If
you and I are going to continue, I do not wish to hurt his feelings. <br>
TROI: Worf, I think it's all right to concentrate on our feelings,
yours and mine. <br>

PICARD: (in dressing gown) Counsellor! What's today's date? The date! <br>
WORF: Stardate 47988. <br>
PICARD: 47988. <br>
TROI: Captain, what's wrong? <br>
PICARD: 47988. I'm not sure. I don't know how or why, but I'm moving

the Enterprise. I was in another time, another place. I was somewhere
in the past. <br>
TROI: Can you describe where you were, what it looked like? <br>
PICARD: You see, it's all slipping away so fast. It's like waking up
from a nightmare. It was years ago. It was before I took command of the
Enterprise. I was talking to someone, I can't remember who. And then it
all changed. I was no longer in the past. I was now an old man in the
future, and I was outside and I was doing something. I can't remember
what it was. I'm sorry, it's all gone. I just can't remember. <br>
TROI: It's all right. Have you considered the possibility that this was
just a dream? <br>
PICARD: No, no, it was much more than a dream. The smells, the sounds,
the very touch of things, much more real than a dream. <br>
TROI: How long did you spend in each time period? Did it seem like
minutes, hours? <br>
PICARD: You see, I can't say. At first I had a sense of confusion,
disorientation. I wasn't sure where I was. And then all that passed and
it all seemed perfectly natural, as though I belonged in that time. But

with the warp core, or the phase inducers, or some other damn thing. <br>
PICARD: Geordi. <br>

PICARD: How about Jean-Luc? <br>
LAFORGE: I don't think I could get used to that. <br>
PICARD: Good Lord, Geordi. Well, how long has it been? <br>
LAFORGE: Nine years. <br>
PICARD: No, no, no. Since you last called me Captain, since we were all
together on the Enterprise? <br>
LAFORGE: Close to twenty five years. <br>
PICARD: Twenty five years. Well, time has been good to you. <br>
LAFORGE: IA little too good to me in some places. Can I give you a hand
here? <br>
PICARD: Oh, well, I'm just tying up some vines. <br>

spray. My wife is quite a gardener. I've picked up a little bit of it. <br>

PICARD: What about the little ones, Brett, Alandra and er? <br>
LAFORGE: Sidney. <br>
PICARD: Sidney. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, they're not so little any more. Brett is applying to
Starfleet Academy next year. <br>
PICARD: So what brings you here? <br>
LAFORGE: Oh I just thought I'd stop by. Been thinking about the old

PICARD: Geordi, you don't make the trip from Rigel Three to Earth just
to drop by. <br>
LAFORGE: No. <br>

LAFORGE: Leah's got a few friends at Starfleet Medical. Word gets
around. <br>
PICARD: I'm not an invalid. Irumodic Syndrome can take years to run its
course. <br>
LAFORGE: I know. Once I heard, well, I just wanted to stop by just the
same. <br>
PICARD: Well now that you're here, you can help me carry those tools.

TASHA: Will this be your first time on a Galaxy class starship? Are you
all right, sir? Sir? <br>
PICARD: I'm sorry, Lieutenant. My mind must have wandered. What were
you saying? <br>
TASHA: I was asking if you'd ever been aboard a Galaxy class starship
before. <br>
PICARD: No. Of course, I'm familiar with the blueprints and
specifications, but this will be my first time aboard. <br>
TASHA: Well then, if I may be so bold, sir, you're in for a treat. The
Enterprise is quite a ship. <br>
PICARD: I'm sure she is. <br>
TASHA: Have I done something wrong, sir? <br>
PICARD: No. It's just that you look very familiar. <br>
CREWMAN [OC]: Enterprise to shuttlecraft Galileo. You are cleared for
arrival in shuttlebay two. <br>

don't see anything that might cause hallucinations or a psychogenic
reaction. <br>
TROI: Is there any indication of temporal displacement? <br>
CRUSHER: No. Usually a temporal shift would leave some kind of
triptamine residue in the cerebral cortex, but the scan didn't show
any. Personally, I think you just enjoy waking everybody up in the
middle of the night. <br>
PICARD: Actually, I really like running around the ship in my bare
feet. <br>
OGAWA: (visibly pregnant) The biospectral test results, Doctor. <br>
CRUSHER: Your blood gas analysis is consistent with someone who's been
breathing the ship's air for weeks. If you'd been somewhere else, there
would be an indication of change in the oxygen isotope ratios. Thanks.
Deanna, would you excuse us please? <br>
TROI: Of course. <br>
(Troi leaves) <br>
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc, I scanned for evidence of Irumodic Syndrome, as you
suggested. There wasn't any. But I did find a small structural defect
in the parietal lobe. <br>
PICARD: A defect that you hadn't noticed before? <br>
CRUSHER: It's the kind of defect that would only show up on a level
four neurographic scan. It could cause you to be susceptible to several
kinds of neurological disorders including Irumodic Syndrome. Now, it's
possible for you to live with this defect for the rest of your life
without developing a problem. Or even if you do, many people continue
to live normal lives for a long time after the onset of Irumodic
Syndrome. <br>
PICARD: If that's so, why do you look like you've just signed my death
sentence? <br>
CRUSHER: I'm sorry. I guess it caught me off guard. <br>
PICARD: I wouldn't worry about it. Something tells me that you're going
to have to put up with me for a long time to come. <br>
CRUSHER: Well, it won't be easy, but I'll manage. <br>
(Riker enters) <br>
RIKER: Captain. <br>
PICARD: Has Worf found anything? <br>
RIKER: No, sir. His security scans came up negative. They're still
checking the sensor logs but there is no indication that you ever left
the ship. <br>
PICARD: I wasn't dreaming. Something happened. <br>
WORF [OC]: Worf to Captain. <br>
PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Worf. <br>
WORF: Sir, there is an incoming transmission from Admiral Nakamura. It
is a priority one message. <br>

PICARD: Admiral. <br>
NAKAMURA [on monitor]: I am initiating a fleet-wide Yellow Alert.
Starfleet intelligence has picked up some alarming reports from the
Romulan Empire. It appears that at least thirty Warbirds have been
pulled from other assignments and are headed for the Neutral Zone. <br>
PICARD: Is there any explanation why they would make such a blatantly
aggressive move? <br>
NAKAMURA [on monitor]: Our operatives on Romulus have indicated that
there appears to be something happening in the Neutral Zone,
specifically in the Devron System. Our own long range scans have picked
up some kind of spatial anomaly in the area. We can't tell what it is. <br>
PICARD: What are our orders? <br>
NAKAMURA [on monitor]: This is a very delicate situation. I am
deploying fifteen starships along our side of the Neutral Zone. I want
you to go there as well. See if you can find out what is going on in
the Devron System. <br>
PICARD: Am I authorised to enter the Neutral Zone? <br>
NAKAMURA [on monitor]: Not yet. Wait and see what the Romulans do. You
can conduct long range scans, send probes if necessary, but do not
cross the border unless they do. <br>
PICARD: Understood. <br>

LAFORGE: What do you mean? You've been right here with me. <br>
PICARD: No, no, no! I was somewhere else. I was, it was a long time
ago. There was someone talking. I was talking to someone. Beverly. I
was talking to Beverly. <br>
LAFORGE: It's okay, Captain. Everything's going to be all right. <br>
PICARD: I'm not senile, you know. This did happen. I was here, I was
talking to you, and then I was somewhere else. I was on the Enterprise.
I was back on the Enterprise. At least, I think that's where it was. I
was in Sickbay. Well, it might have been a hospital. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain, I think we should go back to the house and call your
doctor <br>
PICARD: Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking. It's the Irumodic
Syndrome. He's beginning to lose his mind, the old man. Well, it's not
that. And I'm not daydreaming either. <br>

here. They certainly treat professors pretty well at Cambridge <br>
DATA: Holding the Lucasian Chair does have its perquisites. This house
originally belonged to Sir Isaac Newton when he held the position. It's
become the traditional residence. <br>

DATA: Captain, how long has it been since you've seen a physician about
your Irumodic Syndrome? <br>
PICARD: A week. They've prescribed peridaxon. <br>
DATA: But sir, peridaxon <br>
PICARD: Yes, I know, it's not a cure, There's nothing that can prevent
the deterioration of the synaptic pathways. You think that I'm senile,
that all this is just a delusion. <br>
LAFORGE: Now come on, Captain, no one said anything of the kind. <br>
DATA: In all honesty, Captain, the thought has occurred to me. However,
there's nothing to disprove what you're saying. So it's possible
something is happening to you. The first thing we should do is run a
complete series of neurographic scans. We can use the equipment at the
biometrics lab here on the campus. Jessel, ask Professor Ripper to take
over my lecture for tomorrow. Possibly for the rest of the week.
Captain, we'll get to the bottom of this. <br>

PICARD: Yes. <br>
RIKER: What happened? <br>
PICARD: It's still a little vague, but I can remember more this time.
It seems that every time I shift periods, I can retain more memory. At
first, it appeared that I was in the future, years from now, and then I
was in the past just before our first mission. <br>
RIKER: What is it? <br>
CRUSHER: I just scanned his temporal lobe and compared it to the scan I
performed just a few minutes before. There's a thirteen percent
increase in the acetylcholine of the hippocampus. Within a matter of

you remember Starfleet diverting us from Farpoint to the Neutral Zone

you described. Events in one time period would seem to have no effect

same anomaly in the Devron System. I find it hard to believe that
that's a coincidence. <br>

spatial anomaly in, in, in the Devron system. In Devron system in the
Neutral Zone. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain. <br>
PICARD: If the anomaly appeared there in the past, then it might be
here too and we have to find out. <br>

LAFORGE: All right. Okay. But first, there is no Neutral Zone,
remember? <br>
PICARD: Right. Right. Klingons. In this time period, the Klingons have
taken over the Romulan Empire. <br>
LAFORGE: Right now relations between us and the Klingons aren't too

PICARD: I know that. I haven't completely lost my mind, you know. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, if we're going to the Devron system, we're going to need
a ship. <br>

Contact Admiral Riker, Starbase two four seven. <br>
(later) <br>
RIKER [on viewscreen]: Jean-Luc, you know I'd like to help, but
frankly, what you're asking for is impossible. The Klingons have closed
their borders to all Federation starships. <br>
PICARD: Will, if this spatial anomaly really is in the Devron System. <br>
RIKER [on viewscreen]: I saw a report from Starfleet Intelligence this
morning on that sector. There is no activity. There is nothing unusual
going on in the Devron system. <br>
PICARD: Well I don't believe it! What if their long range scanners are
faulty? We have to go there and see for ourselves. <br>
RIKER [on viewscreen]: Look, I've got the Yorktown out near the border.
I'll have her run some long range scans in the Devron System. If she
finds out anything, I'll let you know. <br>
PICARD: Will, that is just not good enough. <br>
RIKER [on viewscreen]: It's going to have to be. I'm sorry. It's all I
can do. Riker out. <br>

PICARD: Damn him, anyway. After all we've been through together. He's
been sitting behind that desk too long. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain, I'm sorry. I guess all we can do now is wait and see
if the Yorktown finds anything. <br>
DATA: There is another option. We could arrange passage aboard a
medical ship. <br>
PICARD: Medical ship? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. There was an outbreak of Terrellian plague on Romulus.
The Klingons have been allowing Federation medical ships to cross the

PICARD: Yes. Yes! <br>

Q: Mon capitane. I thought you'd never get here. <br>
PICARD: Q. I knew it. What's going on? <br>
Q: It's Judge Q to you. And isn't it obvious what's going on? <br>
PICARD: The last time that I stood here was seven years ago. <br>
Q: Seven years ago. How little do you mortals understand time. Must you
be so linear, Jean-Luc? <br>
PICARD: You accused me of being the representative of a barbarous
species. <br>
Q: I believe my exact words were a dangerous, savage, child race. <br>
PICARD: We demonstrated to you that mankind had become peaceful and
benevolent. You agreed and you let us go on our way.
Now why am I standing here again? <br>
Q: Oh, you'd like me to connect the dots for you, lead you from A to B
to C so your puny mind can comprehend.
How boring. They'd be so much more entertained if you tried to figure
it out. I'll answer any ten questions that call for a yes or a no.
Well? <br>
PICARD: Are you putting mankind on trial again? <br>
Q: No. <br>
PICARD: Is there any connection between the trial seven years ago and
whatever's going on now? <br>
Q: I'd have to say yes. <br>
PICARD: The spatial anomaly in the Neutral Zone, is it related to
what's happening? <br>
Q: Most definitely yes. <br>
PICARD: Is it part of a Romulan plot, a ploy to start a war? <br>
Q: No and no. Five down. <br>
PICARD: That's only four. <br>
Q: Is it a Romulan plot? Is it a ploy to start a war? Those are
separate questions. <br>
PICARD: Did you create the anomaly? <br>
Q: No, no, no. You're going to be so surprised when you realise where
it came from, if you ever figure it out. <br>
PICARD: Are you responsible for my shifting through time? <br>
Q: I'll answer that question if you promise you won't tell anyone. (in
Picard's ear) Yes. <br>
PICARD: Why? <br>
Q: Sorry. That's not a yes or no question. You forfeit the rest of your
questions. I expected as much. You're such a limited creature. A
perfect example of why we made our decision. The trial never ended,
Captain. We never reached a verdict. But now we have. You're guilty. <br>
PICARD: Guilty of what? <br>
Q: Of being inferior. Seven years ago I said we'd be watching you, and
we have been, hoping that your ape-like race would demonstrate some
growth, give some indication that your minds have room for expansion.
But what have we seen instead? You worrying about Commander Riker's
career, listening to Counsellor Troi's pedantic psychobabble, indulging
Data in his witless exploration of humanity. <br>
PICARD: We've journeyed to countless new worlds, we've contacted new
species, we have expanded our understanding of the universe. <br>
Q: In your own paltry, limited way. You have no idea how far you still
have to go. But instead of using the last seven years to change and to
grow, you have squandered them. <br>
PICARD: We are what we are, and we're doing the best we can. It is not
for you to set the standards by which we should be judged. <br>
Q: Oh, but it is, and we have. Time may be eternal, Captain, but our
patience is not. It's time to put an end to your trek through the
stars, make room for other more worthy species. <br>
PICARD: You're going to deny us travel through space? <br>
Q: You obtuse piece of flotsam. You are to be denied existence.
Humanity's fate has been sealed. You will be destroyed. <br>
PICARD: Q, I do not believe that even you are capable of such an act. <br>
Q: I? There you go again, always blaming me for everything. Well this
time I'm not your enemy. I'm not the one that causes the annihilation
of mankind. You are. <br>
PICARD: Me? <br>
Q: That's right. You're doing it right now. You did it before and
you'll do it again. <br>
PICARD: What sort of meaningless doubletalk is this? <br>
Q: He doesn't understand. I have only myself to blame, I suppose. I
believed in you. I thought you had potential. But apparently I was
wrong. May whatever god you believe in have mercy on your soul. This

getting a big laugh out of watching us jump through his hoops. <br>
PICARD: Normally I would agree with you, but this time I feel that
somehow it is different. There was a deadly earnestness about him. I
think he's serious. Which means that in some fashion, I am going to be
the cause of the destruction of humanity. <br>

different time periods? <br>

mankind. What if you were needed on the Bridge at a key moment, and you
weren't there? <br>
TROI: I don't think we can start second guessing ourselves. I think we
have to proceed normally and deal with each situation as it occurs. <br>
PICARD: Agreed. I've been thinking about my conversation with Q. He
admitted that he was responsible for my shifting through time. Now it
occurred to me that he might be giving me a chance somehow to save
humanity. <br>
RIKER: What makes you say that? <br>
PICARD: Well, he's always had a certain fascination with humanity, with
myself in particular. I think he has more than a passing interest in
what happens to me. <br>
DATA: That is true. Q's interest in you has always been very similar to
that of a master and his beloved pet. That was only an analogy,
Captain. <br>
PICARD: If I weren't travelling through time I would never have
realized that the anomaly in the Neutral Zone appeared there in the
past as well. Assuming that's an important piece of a larger puzzle, my
ability to shift through time may be the key to understanding what's

between anti-time and normal time is analogous to the relationship
between antimatter and normal matter. <br>

believe this is what happened in the Devron system. The rupture may be
sending out waves of temporal energy which are disrupting the normal

Q: The Continuum didn't think you had it in you, Jean-Luc, but I knew
you did. <br>
PICARD: Are you saying that it worked? We collapsed the anomaly? <br>
Q: Is that all this meant to you? Just another spatial anomaly? Just
another day at the office? <br>
PICARD: Did it work? <br>
Q: Well, you're here, aren't you? You're talking to me, aren't you? <br>
PICARD: What about my crew? <br>
Q: The anomaly. My crew. My ship. I suppose you're worried about your
fish, too. Well, if it puts your mind at ease, you've saved humanity
once again. <br>
PICARD: Thank you. <br>
Q: For what? <br>
PICARD: You had a hand in helping me get out of this. <br>
Q: I was the one that got you into it. A directive from the Continuum.
The part about the helping hand, thought, was my idea. <br>
PICARD: I sincerely hope that this is the last time that I find myself
here. <br>
Q: You just don't get it, do you, Jean-Luc? The trial never ends. We
wanted to see if you had the ability to expand your mind and your
horizons. And for one brief moment, you did. <br>
PICARD: When I realised the paradox. <br>
Q: Exactly. For that one fraction of a second, you were open to options
you had never considered. That is the exploration that awaits you. Not
mapping stars and studying nebulae, but charting the unknowable
possibilities of existence. <br>
PICARD: Q, what is it that you're trying to tell me? <br>
(Q nearly whispers in Picard's ear) <br>
Q: You'll find out. In any case, I'll be watching. And if you're very
lucky, I'll drop by to say hello from time to time. See you out there.

LAFORGE: Four hands in a row. How does he do it? <br>
RIKER: I cheat. I'm kidding. <br>
CRUSHER: You know, I was thinking about what the Captain told us about
the future. About how we all changed and drifted apart. Why would he
want to tell us what's to come? <br>
LAFORGE: Sure goes against everything we've heard about not polluting
the time line, doesn't it. <br>
DATA: I believe, however, this situation is unique. Since the anomaly
did not occur, there have already been changes in the way this time
line is unfolding. The future we experience will undoubtedly be
different from the one the Captain encountered. <br>
RIKER: Maybe that's why he told us. Knowing what happens in that future
allows us to change things now, so that some things never happen. <br>

ago. <br>
