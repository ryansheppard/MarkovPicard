Captain's log, Stardate 43714.1. We have finally succeeded in
eradicating the Phyrox plague on Cor Caroli Five, and will soon be
preparing to leave orbit and proceed to our next mission. A rendezvous
with the USS Hood to assist their terraforming efforts on Browder Four.

PICARD: Picard, of the Enterprise. <br>
HARO: Captain Picard. We studied your missions at the Academy Mitena
Haro, first year cadet, Starfleet Academy. <br>

THOLL: Perhaps you can explain what this is all about. <br>
(A tall, white-skinned alien wearing a hood) <br>
PICARD: Unfortunately, I can't, Mister <br>
THOLL: Tholl. Kova Tholl, of Mizar Two. <br>
PICARD: Well, Mister Tholl, all I know is that I've been brought here
against my will. Wherever here is. <br>
HARO: The same thing happened to me, sir. I was alone, studying and I
fainted. When I came to, it was about three days ago. <br>
PICARD: And you, sir? <br>
THOLL: I've been here twelve days, possibly more. I had been meditating
privately and for no reason whatever, I lost
consciousness. <br>
PICARD: What can you tell me about our captors? <br>
THOLL: Nothing. They've never shown themselves. <br>
PICARD: Four sleeping areas. That implies we may be joined by another
captive. <br>
(He goes to the central thing, which dispenses red roundels) <br>
THOLL: It's edible, but I wouldn't call it food. <br>
(Picard takes a tentative bite and puts it down, then goes to the panel
by the door) <br>
THOLL: I wouldn't touch that. <br>
PICARD: Why not? <br>
THOLL: If it's the door lock, the combination's too complex to hit at
random. I tried it and was punished. <br>
PICARD: Punished? How? <br>
THOLL: Severe pain. Some sort of energy beam. I won't get near that
panel again. </font></p>

PICARD 2: Thank you, Lieutenant. Mister Data, the nearest pulsar is in
the Lonka cluster, is it not? <br>
DATA: Correct, sir. <br>
PICARD 2: What do we know about that pulsar? <br>
DATA: A great deal, sir. It is a rotating neutron star of approximately
four point three five six solar masses. <br>
PICARD 2: Mister Crusher, how long would it take us to get there? <br>
WESLEY: At warp seven, thirty four minutes. <br>
PICARD 2: Mister Crusher make it so. <br>
WESLEY: Sir? <br>
PICARD 2: Set course for the Lonka pulsar. Warp two. <br>

THOLL: Picard, what are you doing? <br>
PICARD: Attempting to let our captors know that we possess
intelligence. <br>
THOLL: You don't think they already know that? They can hear us
talking. <br>
PICARD: Yes, but they may not realise that we're communicating through
language. <br>
HARO: Captain Picard is letting them know we comprehend mathematics by
tapping out the first six prime numbers. <br>
THOLL: I know what he's doing. I'm trying to understand why. <br>
PICARD: It is imperative that we communicate with our abductors, find
out what they want. <br>
THOLL: Obviously, they want us. <br>
PICARD: Obviously. But why? What made our captors choose us? What makes
us special? <br>
HARO: I couldn't say, Captain. I'm certainly not special. I am just one
cadet. <br>
PICARD: What's your best area of study? <br>
HARO: Impulse propulsion systems. I'm very good with field coils. <br>
PICARD: Good enough to be useful to our abductors? <br>
HARO: I don't know. Maybe. But if they needed an engineer, sir, why
didn't they take a real one? Why pick a Starfleet cadet? <br>
PICARD: That I can't answer. The Bolians are maintaining an uneasy
truce with the Moropa, are they not? <br>
HARO: That's right. But this doesn't look like Moropa technology and,
even assuming the Moropa wanted me, what would they want with either of
you? <br>
THOLL: I've never even heard of the Moropa. My race has no enemies. <br>
PICARD: None? In the last three hundred years of Mizarian history, your
planet has been conquered six times! <br>
THOLL: And we've survived by not resisting. Mizarians value peace above
confrontation. <br>
PICARD: Then you have no idea who might have done this. <br>
THOLL: No. I don't know of anyone who bears malice toward my race. <br>
PICARD: Or against you personally? <br>
THOLL: You can't mean to suggest that someone with a personal grudge
against me has gone to all this trouble. <br>
PICARD: I'm not suggesting anything. I'm merely trying to come up with
some explanation for your abduction. <br>
THOLL: I'm sorry, Picard. I can't give you one. I am neither important
enough to hold for ransom nor radical enough to be dangerous. I'm a
simple public servant. <br>
PICARD: Nevertheless, Mister Tholl <br>
(There's a sound and a sparkling, and a figure in leather appears on
the fourth bed. He has lots of red hair and sharp teeth, and pulls a
dagger) <br>
PICARD: Stop! We mean you no harm. We are prisoners, like yourself. We
are not the enemy. <br>
ESOQQ: Who has done this? <br>
PICARD: We don't know. We were brought here the same way you were. Our
captors refuse to show themselves. <br>

PICARD: For quite a while, Mister Tholl. I am perfectly willing to
entertain the hypothesis that our captors are Romulans.
But what would the Romulans want with you? <br>

CRUSHER: He came in for a physical with no word from me. <br>
WORF: Anything unusual, Doctor? <br>
CRUSHER: Every test result identical to his last physical, which is
kind of unusual in itself, actually. <br>
RIKER: Almost as though he wanted to establish that there was nothing
wrong. <br>
CRUSHER: There was one other thing. He asked me to dinner in his cabin,
and it was a very unusual evening. <br>
RIKER: Which brings up a very serious possibility. What if there's an
outside influence at work here? <br>
TROI: I detect no evidence of telepathic coercion. <br>
DATA: Commander, there is still one fact we have not considered. The
abnormal energy reading in the Captain's quarters was never explained. <br>
WORF: It is not enough evidence to justify mutiny. <br>
RIKER: Nobody has suggested removing the Captain from command. Right
now, all we have are suspicions. Not enough to act upon. The next move
is his.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THOLL: Well, Picard? Prove to us you're not the
enemy. <br>
PICARD: I can't. You're right, Mister Tholl. Any of us may be the
enemy. And there is no way to prove that we aren't. But until we set
aside our mutual fears and trust one another, we have no hope of
escape. <br>
HARO: But sir, how can we trust each other? <br>
THOLL: She's right. There may be an enemy among us. <br>
PICARD: And what if there is, Mister Tholl? Shall we continue accusing
one another until hostility leads to violence? Shall we allow our
suspicions to destroy us? Now, let's see if we can override this stun
mechanism. </font></p>

kilometres. <br>
WESLEY: Aye, sir. <br>
RIKER: Mister Worf, divert enough power to the shields to offset the
increased radiation and magnetic fields. <br>
DATA: Sir, at twenty million kilometres, our shields will only be
effective for eighteen minutes. <br>
PICARD 2: Noted, Mister Data. <br>
RIKER: Captain, may I have a word with you? <br>
PICARD 2: You have the Bridge, Mister Data. <br>

PICARD 2: I'm under no obligation to tell you that. <br>
RIKER: If you don't, you force me to take command of this vessel. <br>
PICARD 2: On what grounds? <br>
RIKER: You are endangering this ship for no reason. <br>
PICARD 2: No reason you're aware of. <br>
RIKER: That's not good enough. Your behaviour has been erratic. <br>
PICARD 2: Erratic enough to justify mutiny? Do you honestly believe you
have sufficient evidence to convince a board of inquiry? <br>
RIKER: No, I don't. But I can't let you risk the lives of this crew. <br>
PICARD 2: Number One, has it occurred to you that you might be the one
with the problem? I'm aware you've been under stress, and I am willing
to let the matter drop if you will report to Sickbay for a full
examination. Otherwise, I will have to relieve you from duty. Think
about it.

Increasing power to number three shield to compensate. <br>
PICARD 2: Helm, move us closer. Ten million kilometres. <br>

fields and radiation. We will not survive. <br>
PICARD 2: Take us in, Mister Crusher. <br>
RIKER: Belay that order. <br>
PICARD 2: You're relieved of duty, Commander. Mister Worf, confine
Mister Riker to his quarters. <br>
(Worf stands still and puts his hands behind his back) <br>
PICARD 2: Mister Worf, I gave you an order. <br>
RIKER: Maintain your position, Lieutenant. <br>
PICARD 2: You're destroying yourself and anyone who is foolish enough
to listen to you. <br>
RIKER: You've shown none of the concern that Captain Picard would for
the safety of his ship, the welfare of his crew. <br>
PICARD 2: Mister Worf, escort Commander Riker from the Bridge. <br>
RIKER: Ensign Crusher, take us away from this pulsar. Heading one eight
five mark three two. Full impulse. <br>
WESLEY: Full impulse. Aye, Commander. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THOLL: I hope you're satisfied, Picard. You've
accomplished nothing. <br>
ESOQQ: The sound of your voice is beginning to anger me. <br>
PICARD: Well, I think this charade has gone far enough. (to Haro) Don't
you? <br>
HARO: I don't understand. <br>
PICARD: Oh yes, you do. This isn't a holding cell. It's a laboratory
maze, a carefully structured test. It's an experiment to see how well
we react under pressure. <br>
ESOQQ: How do you know? <br>
PICARD: It's the only explanation. Look at the four of us. We do have
something in common. We all react differently to authority. You, the
collaborator, defer to whoever has control. You, the anarchist, reject
authority in any form. I, a Starfleet Captain, trained to command. And
you, a Starfleet cadet, sworn to obey a superior officer's authority.
Our captors have placed us here and have devised obstacles for us to
overcome. They give us food which Esoqq can't eat, to make him a
threat. They give us a door we can't open until the four of us
co-operate. And each time we succeed, they deal us reverses to set us
against each other again, while you observe our reactions. <br>
HARO: Sir, I've been trying to help. <br>
PICARD: I found it unlikely that a first year cadet would know of the
Enterprise's visit to Mintaka Three, so I tested you. Starfleet has
classified the Cor Caroli Five plague as secret. No cadet would have
knowledge of that incident. <br>
HARO: Captain. <br>
PICARD: So you may as well drop this pretence. I'm not playing any
further. I'm quitting the game. As far as I am concerned, this
experiment is over! <br>
HARO: You are correct, Captain Picard. <br>
(And she morphs into three balls of light which then become three
identical aliens with the same voice) <br>
ALIEN 1: To further our knowledge of alien interaction, we borrowed
you, Tholl, and Esoqq, and replaced you with replicas. <br>
ESOQQ: Replicas? <br>
ALIEN 2: Our transporter is able to replicate living matter, including
the brain's many trillion dendritic connections where memory is stored.
<br>
THOLL: You mean there's a copy of me on Mizar Two? <br>
PICARD: An impostor running my ship. <br>
ALIEN 2: No longer. Commander Riker has taken charge of the Enterprise.
<br>
ALIEN 1: Our species is telepathically linked. We are all in continual
contact. <br>
ALIEN 2: Much more efficient than your primitive vocal communications. <br>
ALIEN 1: We would like to pursue this study, but of course your
awareness of it would taint the results. <br>
ALIEN 2: We will therefore return you to your places of origin.

RIKER: Captain! <br>
PICARD: Hold your positions. Take no action. <br>
(Picard 2 changes into Alien 4) <br>
PICARD: Why did you choose to study the concepts of authority and
leadership? <br>
ALIEN 4: Because our species has no such concepts. <br>
ALIEN 1: As we are all identical, distinctions among ourselves are
meaningless. Hence we have no leaders no followers. <br>
(Riker taps commands into a panel) <br>
ALIEN 4: We wanted to examine the nature of command. <br>
ALIEN 1: Our replicas of Tholl and Esoqq explored this issue on Mizar
Two and on Chalna, just as our Picard replica did on the Enterprise. <br>
(Data follows Riker's lead and puts instructions into his console) <br>
ALIEN 4: Your responses were most intriguing. <br>
PICARD: You have no right to put us through this just to satisfy your
curiosity. <br>
ALIEN 1: Why not? <br>
PICARD: Because kidnapping is an immoral assault. The rights of other
races must be respected. <br>
ALIEN 4: This concept of morality is a very interesting human
characteristic. We shall have to study it sometime. <br>
PICARD: Now, Mister Worf. <br>
(the two aliens are pinned in a forcefield) <br>
ALIEN 1: What is it? <br>
ALIEN 4: Why do you hold us? <br>
PICARD: Because there is something else you can learn. With an alert
crew, even our primitive vocal communications are unnecessary. With a
single look I was able to inform my crew that I wanted to hold you
here. <br>
ALIEN 4: But why? <br>
PICARD: Because I've decided to conduct an experiment of my own. I want
to see how you react to being imprisoned. <br>
ALIEN 1+4: Captain, our species cannot bear captivity. <br>
ALIEN 1: We were merely curious. We meant no harm. <br>
ALIEN 4: We did not, after all, injure you in any way. <br>
PICARD: Imprisonment is an injury, regardless of how you justify. <br>
(Picard signals Worf to release the forcefield) <br>
PICARD: And now that you have had a taste of captivity, perhaps you
will reconsider the morality of inflicting it upon others. In any
event, we now know about your race and we know how to imprison you.
Bear that in mind. Now get off my ship. <br>
(The aliens vanish) <br>
PICARD: Mister Crusher. Set course to rendezvous with the Hood. Warp
eight. <br>
WESLEY: Aye, sir. It's good to have you back, sir. <br>
PICARD: Status, Number One? <br>
RIKER: Ship and crew functioning normally, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Then my doppelganger caused no serious damage? The replica was
convincing? <br>
RIKER: Very convincing, but not perfect. <br>
PICARD: Not perfect in what way? <br>
RIKER: Well, sir, I find it hard to believe you're that good a singer. <br>
PICARD: A singer? I look forward to reading your report, Commander. At
least, I think I do. <br>
(Doctor Crusher enters) <br>
PICARD: Doctor <br>
CRUSHER: Captain. <br>
