Captain's log, stardate 41601.3. We are crossing through the Zed Lapis
sector, where we will rendezvous with shuttlecraft thirteen, carrying
Deanna Troi, who is returning from a conference. Because Engineering is
involved in preventive maintenance on our dilithium crystals, we are
presently travelling on impulse power.

WORF: Not yet, sir. Still probing. It appears to be buried under a lot
of debris. I may have something, sir. Faint life signs. Very faint. <br>
RIKER: How many? <br>
WORF: There's no way of telling from here. <br>
PICARD: Data, can we beam up the injured? <br>

are powerless to communicate or use the transporter unless it allows
it. <br>

Tasha and it could have killed us, but it didn't. Deanna and Ben are
alive for a reason, and it knows we're not going anywhere as long as
they're still alive. <br>

have the chart of the energy field surrounding the shuttle. <br>
PICARD: There are a great deal of fluctuations. <br>
WORF: Yes, but there is a pattern. Here is when it killed Lieutenant
Yar, and here is when it absorbed Commander Riker. <br>
PICARD: And here, here, where the energy is lowest? <br>
WORF: Both times it had enveloped the shuttle. <br>
PICARD: It has something to do with Counsellor Troi. Somehow when it's
dealing with her, the energy field is affected. I want to talk to her.
I'm going to beam down. Lieutenant Worf, you have the conn. </font></p>

TROI: Imzadi! No! Please, stop hurting him! <br>
ARMUS [OC]: He resists. If he would give himself over, the pain would
diminish. He struggles. You should feel his strength. <br>
TROI: I can. <br>
ARMUS [OC]: Should I let him go? <br>
TROI: You only ask to torment me. <br>
ARMUS [OC]: Perhaps. <br>
TROI: How should I answer? What can I offer except myself? <br>
ARMUS [OC]: And would you give yourself for him? Would you give that
much? <br>
TROI: Yes. Without hesitation. <br>
ARMUS [OC]: Just for him? <br>
TROI: No, not just for him. I would do the same for any of the others.
Armus, you have me. Let them go. <br>

them) <br>
ARMUS: You are the one in charge? <br>
PICARD: (to Data) Is Commander Riker alive? <br>
ARMUS: Answer, Tin Man. <br>
DATA: I would guess that death is no longer sufficient entertainment to
alleviate its boredom. Therefore, Commander Riker is alive. <br>
ARMUS: Maybe. Don't you want to ask me what I want? <br>
PICARD: No. <br>
ARMUS: Not even to protect your own existence? <br>
PICARD: I want to see my people in the shuttle. <br>
ARMUS: Entertain me. (Picard shakes his head) Then I will do it myself.
You, Tin Man. <br>
(Data moves jerkily, and points his phaser at Beverly, then Picard) <br>
ARMUS: Now tell me, how would you feel if you were the instrument of
death for your leader? <br>
PICARD: Don't struggle, Data. <br>
DATA: I have no control over what you do with the phaser. Therefore, I
would not be the instrument of his death. <br>
ARMUS: Perhaps killing the Doctor would engender more feeling? <br>
DATA: No, the control is still yours. <br>
ARMUS: And what about you, Doctor? Are you ready to die? Tell me you
are not afraid. <br>
CRUSHER: I am afraid. <br>
ARMUS: Beg me to spare you. <br>
CRUSHER: No. <br>
ARMUS: One of you is going to die, and you, Doctor, get to choose. You
don't like that, do you? <br>
CRUSHER: Then I choose myself. <br>
ARMUS: No. You are going to live. One of them dies. <br>
(Data's arm swings around and ends pointing the phaser at his own head)
<br>
ARMUS: Maybe this one. Though I would not call it death, since he is
only a device. Tell me, Tin Man, how does it feel to face your own
extinction. <br>
DATA: Curious. (the phaser drops) You are capable of great sadism and
cruelty. Interesting. No redeeming qualities. <br>
ARMUS: So what do you think? <br>
DATA: I think you should be destroyed. <br>
ARMUS: A moral judgment from a machine. <br>
PICARD: Data. Armus, we're finished dealing with you. <br>
ARMUS: I have your man in here, and the others in the shuttle. <br>
PICARD: It doesn't matter. We will no longer be a source of amusement. <br>
ARMUS: I can kill them. <br>
PICARD: Yes. You can. But only I can command them. They follow my
orders. <br>
ARMUS: Have them amuse me. <br>
PICARD: Only if you let me see my people on the shuttle first. I must
see them. <br>
ARMUS: Not possible. <br>
PICARD: Then our business with you is concluded. <br>
ARMUS: And you claim you care about your comrades. <br>
PICARD: I care. Which is why I must see them. <br>
ARMUS: You want to see your people? Then, here. Look at this one. <br>
(Riker is tossed out of the slick, covered in oil) <br>
CRUSHER: He's alive. Don't move. <br>
PICARD: Is he all right? <br>
CRUSHER: All signs show normal. <br>
RIKER: So much frustration. It had to get rid of me. <br>
PICARD: Now, let me see the others. <br>
ARMUS: No. <br>
PICARD: I will not allow my people to entertain you until you do. <br>
ARMUS: They are incapable of entertaining me. <br>
PICARD: I want the four of you out of here. Enterprise, beam up the
away team immediately. <br>
WORF [OC]: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: They're no longer involved. This is between you and me. <br>
ARMUS: They may leave. <br>
(The team are beamed away) <br>
PICARD: Now. <br>
ARMUS: I want to leave this place. <br>
PICARD: You want me to give you transportation? <br>
ARMUS: For which I will trade you lives. <br>
PICARD: I must see my people in the shuttle. <br>

TROI: Were you able to help Tasha? <br>
PICARD: No. Troi. Troi, we must talk. I believe it's possible to
outmanoeuvre this creature, and beam you and Ben back up to the ship.
We've been monitoring the energy field that surrounds the shuttle. When
the creature is here, the field weakens. Do you know why? <br>
TROI: The creature is filled with rage. Undirected, unfocused rage.
When he confronts it, his guard goes down because he's feeling it
instead of suppressing it. Acknowledging his needs makes him
vulnerable. <br>
PICARD: What caused the rage? <br>

ARMUS: Since they left. A very long time. <br>
PICARD: A long time to be alone. <br>
ARMUS: Save your compassion. It's revolting. You offer it like a prize
when in fact it's an insult. <br>
PICARD: Because you feel unworthy. <br>

things evil'. <br>
ARMUS: You do not understand. I do not serve things evil. I am evil. <br>

ARMUS: I am a skin of evil left here by a race of Titans who believed
if they rid themselves of me, they would free the bonds of
destructiveness. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: We are here together to honour our friend
and comrade, Lieutenant Natasha Yar. Coming to terms with the loss of a
colleague is perhaps the most difficult tasks we must face in the work
we have chosen to pursue. We will all find time to grieve for her in
the days that are ahead, but for now she has asked that we celebrate
her life with this. <br>
(An image of Tasha appears on a stand) <br>
TASHA: Hello, my friends. You are here now watching this image of me
because I have died. It probably happened while I was on duty, and
quickly, which is what I expected. Never forget I died doing exactly
what I chose to do. What I want you to know is how much I loved my
life, and those of you who shared it with me.
You are my family. You all know where I came from and what my life was
like before. But Starfleet took that frightened, angry young girl and
tempered her. I have been blessed with your friendship and your love.
Will Riker, you are the best. You trusted me, you encouraged me, and
most of all you made me laugh. Deanna, you are capable of so much love.
You taught me without ever having to say a word. I realised I could be
feminine without losing anything. Ah, Worf. We are so much alike, you
and I. Both warriors, orphans who found ourselves this family. I hope I
met death with my eyes wide open. Beverly. Your fierce devotion comes
from within. It can't be diminished. From you, I have learned to strive
for excellence, no matter what the personal cost. Wesley, I'm sorry I
won't be able to see you grow into the exceptional man you'll be. But
your kindness and innocence are ageless. Geordi, in those moments I
felt the most despair, you took my hand and helped me to see things
differently. You taught me to look beyond the moment. My friend Data.
You see things with the wonder of a child, and that makes you more
human than any of us. Captain Jean-Luc Picard. I wish I could say
you've been like a father to me, but I've never had one, so I don't
know what it feels like. But if there was someone in this universe I
could choose to be like, someone who I would want to make proud of me,
it's you. You who have the heart of an explorer and the soul of a poet.
So, you'll understand when I say, death is that state in which one
exists only in the memory of others. Which is why it is not an end. No
goodbyes. Just good memories. Hailing frequencies closed, sir. <br>
PICARD: Au revoir, Natasha. The gathering is concluded. <br>
(Everyone but Picard and Data leave, sniffing a bit) <br>
DATA: Sir, the purpose of this gathering confuses me. <br>
PICARD: Oh? How so? <br>
DATA: My thoughts are not for Tasha, but for myself. I keep thinking
how empty it will feel without her presence. Did I miss the point? <br>
PICARD: No, you didn't, Data. You got it. </font> </p>
