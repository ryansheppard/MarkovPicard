CRUSHER: Send a message to Commander Data and inform him of our delay. <br>
RAINER: Aye, sir. <br>
(Troi enters) <br>
CRUSHER: Deanna, welcome back. <br>
TROI: Thank you. I was just reporting in. I didn't expect to find
anyone up except Data. <br>
CRUSHER: Data's away on assignment. A Federation deep space probe went
off course and crashed on Barkon Four. Some of the material in the
casing was radioactive, so Data was sent to recover it before it could
contaminate the biosphere. <br>
TROI: Isn't Barkon Four inhabited? <br>
CRUSHER: Yes, it's a pre-industrial society, but the probe crashed over
a hundred kilometres from the nearest settlement so Data shouldn't have
any contact with the Barkonians. So, how was the reunion? <br>
TROI: Fine. It was good to see some old friends. I'd lost touch with
most of them. It's interesting to see the different paths some of their
lives have taken. Beverly, you don't usually stand a watch on the
Bridge even when Data's not here. <br>
CRUSHER: I volunteered tonight. I like to put in a little Bridge time
now and then, stay on top of operations, tactical procedures. The truth
is, I like it. It's not every doctor who gets to command a starship,
even if it is the night shift. <br>
TROI: May I ask you a personal question? Why did you decide to become a
Commander? I mean, you didn't need the rank in order to be Chief
Medical Officer, so why put yourself through all the extra work? <br>
CRUSHER: Oh, I don't know. I never even thought about my rank for a
long time. It seemed pretty trivial compared to being a doctor. But
then, about eight years ago, I started to feel like I wanted to stretch
myself a little. <br>
RAINER: Commander, there's no response from Commander Data to our
signal. <br>
CRUSHER: Continue sending him updates on our schedule. <br>
RAINER: Aye, sir. <br>
TROI: Is something wrong? <br>
CRUSHER: No. I wanted to let Data know there'd be a delay in picking
him up for a few of days. We have orders to rendezvous with the
Lexington and take some medical supplies to the Taranko Colony. <br>
TROI: But he's not responding. <br>
CRUSHER: Geordi said that the radiation from the probe might interfere
with communications. I just thought I'd try anyway. </font></p>

Can you understand me? My name is Garvin. <br>

GARVIN: I thought I told you to go home. <br>
GIA: I know. <br>

you've been in some kind of accident. <br>

GARVIN: What do you remember? <br>
DATA: I walked here from the mountains. <br>
GARVIN: The mountains? The mountains are over two hundred seltons from
here. <br>

GARVIN: Radioactive. What does that mean? <br>

distant place. <br>

It's far less confusing than the way you normally speak. <br>

RIKER: I knew I could count on my Imzadi, the ship's Counsellor to
boost my self-image. <br>
TROI: I'm glad to be of service. <br>
RIKER: Did you come here for something in particular, or just general
Riker bashing? <br>
TROI: Actually I wanted to ask your opinion about something. I've been
thinking about taking the Bridge Officer's test and becoming a full
Commander. <br>
RIKER: What brought this up? <br>
TROI: A lot of things. Working on the personnel review last month,
talking with Beverly about her experiences, going to my class reunion. <br>
RIKER: Ah, the class reunion. You saw a few old friends who had already
taken the test? <br>
TROI: All right, I admit it was a catalyst. But I can honestly say that
I've been thinking about this off and on over the past two years. <br>
RIKER: Why the past two years? <br>
TROI: Do you remember when the Enterprise hit that quantum filament and
I was in command on the Bridge? <br>
RIKER: I do. <br>
TROI: Well, when that happened, I was overwhelmed. But when it was over
I realised that a part of me missed it.
Not the actual disaster, but the experience of being in command. I felt
like I was exploring a whole new side of myself. Not that I want to
give up counselling by any means, but I really would like to stretch
myself a little. <br>
RIKER: Deanna, if you take the Bridge Officer's test, you'll have my
complete support. But as First Officer, I'll be the one judging your
performance, and you should know I am a pretty tough judge. <br>
TROI: And I'm a pretty good student. <br>

TALUR: Remarkable set of teeth. Breath smells like, well, it doesn't
have any smell actually. You can close your mouth. Let's see. Heartbeat
sounds a little odd, but seems very regular. Skin feels clammy, but you
say you feel fine? <br>
DATA: That is correct. <br>
TALUR: No headaches, palpitations, sluggishness, indigestion? <br>
DATA: No. But I cannot have indigestion since I have not eaten. <br>
TALUR: Ah. Malnutrition. You should try to eat something that will
build strength and return your vitality. Lots of meat, butter, cheese,
that should be a start. <br>
GARVIN: What about his eyes and his skin? They're so odd. <br>
TALUR: Quite so, quite so. I'm sure my grandmother would have called
our friend here a demon or spirit or some kind of monster. But current
scientific methodology allows us to dismiss such ridiculous
superstitions and concentrate on scientific reality. <br>
DATA: Then what do you believe I am? <br>
TALUR: You are an ice man. <br>
DATA: Ice man? <br>
TALUR: Yes. You probably come from a race of people who lived in the
snow and ice of the Vellorian mountains. Your skin and eye colouration
are a result of prolonged exposure to harsh winter conditions. <br>
DATA: Then I am not ill? <br>
TALUR: Aside from your memory loss, you do not seem to have any
symptoms of any illness that I am familiar with. No. You are an ice
man. Now, get something to eat and a good night's rest, and I will come
back tomorrow to see if your memory has begun to return. <br>

TALUR: Hello, Gia. <br>
GIA: Hello. <br>
(Talur leaves as Gia enters) <br>
GIA: What did Talur say about him? Is he sick? <br>
GARVIN: Not exactly. She said he's lost his memory, but seems to be
fine otherwise. Talur thinks he's from a race that lives in the
mountains. <br>
DATA: I am an ice man. <br>
GARVIN: We'll have to call you something besides Ice man until your
memory returns. What was the word on the container? <br>

SKORAN: Jayden, huh? The metal is slightly warm. <br>
GARVIN: All the fragments are like that. <br>
(Skoran hit's it with a hammer on the anvil) <br>
SKORAN: It's obviously been tempered and milled. The lustrous quality
of the metal is so pure. This wasn't made in any forge I've ever seen.
Will you sell them? <br>
GARVIN: You want them? <br>
SKORAN: The metal's malleable enough to make some jewellry. <br>
GARVIN: They belong to Jayden. Do you want to sell them? You're going
to need money. <br>
DATA: You may be right. But I do not wish to sell all the fragments.
They may provide a clue to my identity. <br>
SKORAN: I'll give you twenty doraks for half the lot. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TALUR: Rock, fire, sky, and water are the basic
elements of the universe. They can be found in every object, every
person, every animal, everything. The rock in this wood can be felt by
its weight and by its hardness. If we expose the wood to flame, we can
encourage the fire within the wood to show itself. We can also see
smoke, which is a part of the sky. The water in wood is difficult to
see. Sometimes the elements are buried deep within the objects, but the
four elements are always there. (Data raises his hand) Yes, Jayden? <br>
DATA: I do not believe that is correct. <br>
TALUR: Oh? <br>
DATA: I believe you are reasoning by analogy, classifying objects and
phenomena according to superficial observation rather than empirical
evidence. Wood, for example, does not contain fire simply because it is
combustible, nor does it contain rock simply because it is heavy. Wood,
like any complex organic form, is composed of thousands of different
chemical compounds, none of which is fire. <br>
TALUR: That will be enough for now, Jayden. As I told you earlier, our
friend Jayden here has lost much of his memory, so I wouldn't put too
much faith in any of his ideas. Now that will be all for today. I will
see you tomorrow. Be sure to practice your spelling and arithmetic

TALUR: I suspect he (gets a handful of hair) I don't know. I've never
encountered anything like this before. These lesions look like burn
marks. The fluids of his body have overheated. That would explain the
fever and the burning skin. Keep him cool, let plenty of fresh air into

Gia, Garvin and Skoran might have shared that could have a causal
relationship to their illness. <br>
TALUR: Well they've all lived here in the village for many years. I'm
sure they have many common experiences. <br>
DATA: Yes, but since the illness struck all three in a relatively short
period of time, it is reasonable to assume the experience is recent and
unusual. <br>
TALUR: Actually, Jayden, encountering you has been the most unusual
experience that they've all shared recently. <br>
DATA: I am aware of that. Excuse me. I am also open to the possibility
that I may in some way be the causal factor. However, since you have
had a great deal of contact with me and you show no signs of the
sickness, I tend to discount myself as a likely candidate. <br>

(Geordi exits to the Jefferies tube) <br>
RIKER: End simulation. Something told me you wouldn't let this go.
Congratulations. You passed. <br>
TROI: That's what this was all about, wasn't it? To see if I'd order
someone to their death. <br>
RIKER: That's right. <br>
TROI: I knew that was part of being in command and I thought I'd
prepared for it, but when the moment came I hesitated. Maybe you were
right. Maybe I'm not cut out for this. <br>
RIKER: You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your
options, you tried every alternative, and then you made the hard
choice. Come on, let's get out of here, Commander.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: I have coated this piece of cloth with the
liquid which is used in lamps. As you can see, the cloth becomes
luminescent when it is exposed to an energy source. This pendant also
appears to be an energy source. <br>
(flickers on the cloth) <br>
TALUR: But where is this pattern of light coming from? <br>
DATA: I believe a stream of particles is emanating from the metallic
pendant and hitting the cloth. <br>
TALUR: I don't see any particles coming from the pendant. <br>
DATA: You will see there are. I can even block them. <br>
(Data puts the box in between the pendant and the screen) <br>
DATA: It would appear that this container was constructed of a material
which absorbs or blocks the particles coming from the metal. <br>
TALUR: It's a trick. <br>
DATA: No. It is empirical data. I believe the fragments were originally
placed in this container to protect people from accidental exposure.
The word radioactive may be a warning about the dangerous nature of the
metal. <br>
TALUR: All right. Let's say for the moment that you're right, that
there are invisible particles coming from the metal. What should we do?
<br>
DATA: I will continue my experiment. I would like you to gather all the
pieces of metal in the village and place them in this container. <br>
TALUR: All right. But when I return, I want a more thorough explanation
of all this. And I want to examine your data, in detail. <br>
DATA: Of course. <br>
(Talur leaves. A few moments later there is a thumping at the door.
Data opens it.) <br>
SKORAN: There you are. You're the cause of this, Ice man. <br>
DATA: If you are referring to the illness, you are partially correct.
However, it is more complex than that. The metal fragment which <br>
(Data ducks Skoran's attack and sends him against the wall, but his
crony's attack with an axe removes the covering from half of Data's
face) <br>
SKORAN: What, what are you? <br>
(they run away) <br>
DATA: I do not know. <br>
(later, Skoran pours pieces of metal into the box and Talur closes it) <br>
SKORAN: I saw it with my own eyes. He's not a person. He's some kind of
creature. <br>
GIA: It's not true, Father. <br>
SKORAN: We must find him and stop him before he kills us all. <br>
GARVIN: I don't. Not Jayden. He wouldn't try to hurt us. <br>
SKORAN: Come on. <br>
(the armed mob leaves) <br>
TALUR: Let him rest for now. You should rest as well. Exerting yourself
will only make you sicker. I'll be back. <br>
(Talur leaves and Gia goes into the study area. Data is wearing a hood)
<br>
DATA: Gia. <br>
GIA: Jayden? Everyone's looking for you. Skoran said you're some kind
of creature. <br>
DATA: I do not know what I am. But I am not like you. <br>
GIA: I know. You're an Ice man. We talked about that. <br>
DATA: No. I am not. <br>
GIA: Jayden, why are you wearing that hood? <br>
DATA: I do not wish to frighten you. <br>
GIA: I won't be afraid. Take it off. Please, I have to see. <br>
(he does, and she recoils at the flashing lights in his face) <br>
DATA: I understand your reaction. But I do not wish to harm you. You or
Garvin or anyone else. I only wish to help, to find a cure for the
illness. I was very close. I must to continue my work, but it will take
time. How long until Skoran and the others return? <br>
GIA: I don't know. They're looking for you now. <br>
DATA: Then I must hurry. <br>
(hours later, Data comes downstairs with a potion in a bowl) <br>
DATA: Gia, I believe I have found the answer. <br>
GIA: You think you found a cure? <br>
DATA: I believe so. I tested this medicine on skin samples from your
father. They showed improvement, so I administered this to him. He is
now recovering. <br>
GIA: What kind of medicine is it? <br>
DATA: A compound I made which will neutralise the particles that are
making you ill. Swallow this. I must administer this to everyone in the
village, but I do not think they will trust me after what happened to
Skoran. <br>
GIA: I could tell them. <br>
DATA: I am afraid they will not believe you either. Gia, is the well in
the town square the only source of water for this village? <br>
GIA: Well? <br>
DATA: This is very important. Are there any other sources of fresh
water near the village? <br>
GIA: No. The nearest river is two days away. <br>
DATA: Then I will put this compound into the well water. It may be
diluted, but it should still have enough potency to work. <br>
GIA: Compound

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(night, Data uncovers the well and is about to pour
his bucket of cure into it when) <br>
SKORAN: There he is! You see? It's just as I said. <br>
DATA: I only wish to help. <br>
SKORAN: This is how you've helped us, by bringing this plague? Tried to
kill us all? Well, you won't succeed. I won't let you! <br>
(Data pours the compound into the well just as Skoran impales him and
gets an electric shock for his effort. Data falls as Talur arrives)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(another day, and Gia is going to school with her
slate) <br>
CRUSHER: Excuse me. We're looking for a friend of ours. He might have
wandered into your village a few days ago. <br>
RIKER: You'd remember him. He would have appeared very strange. Pale
skin, gold eyes. <br>
GIA: He was your friend? <br>
CRUSHER: Yes. Do you know him? <br>
RIKER: Where is he? <br>
(Gia points to a plaque on a stone) <br>
CRUSHER: I don't understand. <br>
GIA: We didn't know his real name, so we called him Jayden. <br>
RIKER: You're saying he's dead? <br>
GIA: They killed him because they were afraid of him, but he saved all
of us from the sickness. <br>
CRUSHER: The sickness? <br>
GIA: There were these pieces of metal. They made everyone sick. But
Jayden put something in the water and now everyone's better. <br>
RIKER: What happened to these pieces of metal? <br>
GIA: We buried them in the forest. What was his real name? <br>
RIKER: Data. <br>
GIA: Data. He was my friend, too. <br>
(Gia leaves and Beverly gets her tricorder out) <br>
CRUSHER: It's Data all right. He's buried about two metres down. He's
been deactivated so I can't tell how bad the damage is. <br>
RIKER: We could beam him and the probe fragments right onto the ship.
No one would know.

in place and neuroelectrical systems enabled. <br>
(she switches him on and he instantly sits up) <br>
CRUSHER: Data, are you all right? <br>
DATA: I do not know. I am surprised to find myself here. I thought I
was on Barkon Four. <br>
PICARD: What's the last thing you remember? <br>
DATA: I had located the crashed Federation probe and collected the
radioactive fragments. I was attempting to download the sensor logs
from the probe's onboard computer. There was a power surge. I believe
the surge overloaded my positronic matrix. After that, I have no memory
until this moment. (looks at his clothes) It appears I had an
interesting time. <br>
RIKER: We don't know much about what happened either. Apparently you
saved an entire village from radiation poisoning. <br>
CRUSHER: And you were a very special friend to a little girl. <br>
TROI: Well, if you'll excuse me, I have the Bridge this watch. <br>
DATA: Counsellor, have you been promoted in my absence? <br>
TROI: That's right. Which means from now on you can call me sir. <br>
