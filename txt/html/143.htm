Captain's log, Stardate 42779.1. We're en route to the Epsilon Nine
Sector for astronomical survey of a new pulsar cluster. In the
meantime, Ensign Crusher will be diverting to Starbase Five One Five
for Starfleet exams.

quite elementary.<br>
WESLEY: You would.<br>
RIKER: Your earlier test results were good enough to get you Academy
credit for your work here. I don't think you have anything to worry
about. <br>
WESLEY: Those Academy cadets can be extremely competitive. <br>
RIKER: But you have the practical experience, Wes. <br>
DATA: Commander Riker is correct. While the information imparted to
cadets at the Academy is unquestionably vital for prospective Starfleet
officers, it nevertheless requires a significant period of
supplementary systems training and situational disciplines. <br>

Earhart. It was little more than a galactic outpost in those days. <br>

PICARD: That's right. Well, my mates and I were at the Bonestell
Recreation Facility, which was something of a dead rough crossroads at
the time, filled with an assorted bunch of galactic riffraff. When a
trio of Nausicaans came in, they were clearly spoiling for a
confrontation with a group of fresh-faced Starfleet officers such as
ourselves. Well, everyone in the group had the good sense to give these
Nausicaans a wide berth, to stand off. Everyone, that is, except me. I
stood toe to toe with the worst of the three, and I told him&nbsp;what
I thought of him, his pals, his planet, and I possibly made some
passing reference to his questionable parentage. And the next thing I
knew, all three of them were on me and I was fighting for my life. I
was actually doing quite well for a while, too. <br>

joint-lock when, unbeknownst to me, one of his chums drew his weapon
and impaled me through the back. Curious sensation, actually. Not much
pain. Shock, certainly, at the sight of serrated metal sticking through
my chest. A certain giddy warmth. In fact I do actually remember that I
laughed out loud. Well, it pierced my heart, of course. Well, if we'd
not been so near to a medical facility, I would surely have died. <br>
WESLEY: Really? Then what happened? <br>
PICARD: Nothing. I was no hero, Wesley. I was an undisciplined,
loud-mouthed, opinionated young man who was way out of his league. I
learned a very hard, very painful lesson that day, but I learned it
well. I hope you never have to learn it the same way. Care for another
