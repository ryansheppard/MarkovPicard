LEAH: You can just increase the speed of the parallel subspace field
processor to gain a quicker response time <br>
LAFORGE: I want to give us enough power to strengthen the shields and
barrel out of here, not blow us up! <br>
LEAH: This is my design we're talking about. I did all the calculations
myself. <br>
LAFORGE: I don't care if you built it with your bare hands out of an
old Ferengi cargo ship, it's going to go (whee boom) and we're going
with it. <br>
LEAH: I am not used to having people question my judgment. <br>
LAFORGE: And I'm not used to dying. Okay, look. You worked in a lab on
a static model. This is a working machine. It's got tens of thousands
of light years on it. <br>
LEAH: True. <br>
LAFORGE: Damn right. Listen, we'd never be certain that the circuit
paths are sealed. <br>
LEAH: You're good. Very good. <br>
LAFORGE: I know my ship. Inside and out. <br>
LEAH: Well then you must know me inside and out. 'Cos a lot of me is in
here. <br>
LAFORGE: You know, I always wished that a Chief Engineer could be
present when a ship is being built. <br>
LEAH: That's what's wrong with designers. We never get out in space. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, you're there now. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Commander La Forge to the Bridge. <br>
LAFORGE: On my way, Commander. Don't go away. I mean, computer, save

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: How many devices do we think we're dealing
with, Mister Data? <br>
DATA: To create this radiation field would take several hundred
thousand, sir. <br>
RIKER: They've been out there a long time, Data. There must have been
some deterioration. <br>
DATA: There is no way to precisely calculate that, Commander, but it is
likely. <br>
PICARD: Is there any indication of a weakness in a specific part of the
field? <br>
WORF: Nothing substantial, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Of any kind. <br>
WORF: There is a point one percent dip in the strength of the radiation
field at two one mark eight by four two mark zero. <br>
PICARD: I want that point one percent. <br>
RIKER: I recommend we fire directional phasers at those coordinates. <br>
LAFORGE: We won't be able to maintain energy reserves. We might even
lose a few circuits in the new configuration. <br>
PICARD: How critical will the losses be? <br>
LAFORGE: Not enough to shut down our engines, but if we don't make it I
don't know that I can hold the shields. <br>
DATA: There is also the possibility that the phasers will supply the
assimilators with what they need most. Energy. <br>
PICARD: You know, I imagine a very similar discussion taking place on
our neighbour ship over a thousand years ago. Let's hope our decisions
are more successful than theirs were. Mister La Forge, I want you to
return to Engineering and continue with your efforts without delay.
Mister Worf, prepare the phasers. <br>
WORF: Phasers locked on coordinates. <br>
PICARD: Fire. <br>
RIKER: Nothing. <br>
WORF: Radiation levels increasing. Eight percent. Ten percent. <br>

subspace processors to gain a quicker response time? <br>
LEAH: The processors can handle the extra input. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, but how do we reconfigure? <br>

requires termination of all simulations. <br>

LAFORGE: Somehow we have to generate enough energy to get out of here,
but we've got a booby trap that eats energy for breakfast. How do we
fool it, block it, shut it down, anything? Okay, we know for every
movement the Enterprise makes, there's a counter movement by the energy
field. Can we use that to our advantage somehow? <br>
LEAH: Maybe. There must be a time differential between the force and
counter force. If we can just make quick, continuing adjustments in the
linkups before the counterforce reacts, we might just be able to move
this bucket. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah. Yes! (working at a console) Leah, you like Italian food?
<br>
LEAH: Like it? Wait till I make you my fungilli. <br>
LAFORGE: Okay. Fusion reactor uplink to navigation processor. <br>
(But it's not that straight forward) <br>
LAFORGE: But then we have to adjust the vector processor and the drive
coils. This is impossible. <br>
(Leah massages his shoulders) <br>
LAFORGE: Don't do that. <br>
LEAH: I'm sorry. I thought it would feel good. <br>
LAFORGE: I don't want to feel that good right now. What time is it? <br>
LEAH: Coming up on sixteen hundred hours. <br>
LAFORGE: God, what am I supposed to tell the Captain? It's possible and
yet it's not possible. Everything we've done says we can't adjust that
fast, but if we could, it might work. <br>
LEAH: I could do it. <br>
LAFORGE: Data couldn't even do it. It'll take a hundred, maybe even a
thousand adjustments every second. How are you going to do it? It's
humanly impossible. <br>
LEAH: I'm not human. <br>
LAFORGE: You mean the computer could do it. <br>
(Picard enters) <br>
LAFORGE: Captain. Captain, this is a holographic simulation of one of
the propulsion experts who designed the Enterprise engines. Leah
Brahms. We've, I've been examining the force-counter force response
times, trying to see if we could create linkage at maximum power. <br>
PICARD: And? <br>
LAFORGE: There's a chance we could manoeuvre out of this trap if we
turn the ship over to the computer. <br>
PICARD: What kind of chance? <br>
LAFORGE: I don't know yet, but we could programme it and try it out on
a few simulated runs. <br>
PICARD: And this is the only way? <br>

RIKER: Any word from La Forge? <br>
PICARD: He's come up with something that may give us a chance, if we
agree to stay out of it. He proposes to turn total control of the ship
over to the computer because it is capable of making quicker
adjustments than any human being. <br>
RIKER: Computers have always impressed me with their ability to take
orders. I'm not nearly as convinces of their ability to creatively give
them. <br>
PICARD: You know, Number One, you missed something not playing with
model ships. They were the source of imaginary voyages, each holding a
treasure of adventures. Manning the earliest space craft, flying a
aeroplane with only one propeller to keep you in the sky. Can you
imagine that? Now the machines are flying us. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: Everything we've tried to do has been
based on overpowering the trap. More energy, faster adjustments. But
that's exactly what we can't do because that's what we're supposed to
do. That's the booby trap. The answer lies in our own computer, the
mind. The best piece of engineering we'll ever need. <br>
PICARD: But didn't your researches indicate a thousand adjustments per
second would be required? <br>
LAFORGE: Not if we shut everything off. One blast of everything we've
got left for a microsecond to beat the inertia and then we shut it all
down, except minimal life support and two thrusters. No impulse
engines. No computer. <br>
RIKER: One propeller, Captain? <br>
COMPUTER: Deflector shield failure. Lethal radiation levels. Fatal
exposure in twelve minutes. <br>
PICARD: Have you analysed the risk factor? <br>
LAFORGE: The numbers say it's even money. It's no better than turning
it over to the computer, but no worse either. But I say forget the
numbers. There's no way the computer can compensate for the human
factor. The intuition, the experience. <br>
PICARD: And the wish to stay alive. Make it so. <br>

may not fully compensate for acceleration. So brace yourselves. <br>

WORF: No reaction from the assimilator. <br>
RIKER: Okay, we're over the first hurdle. <br>
WORF: Sir! Object to port. <br>
DATA: Port thruster is firing. Sir, the gravitational attraction of the
various masses has reduced our velocity by eight percent. By my
calculations, we no longer have sufficient momentum to clear the debris
field. <br>
PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. <br>
DATA: The asteroid's gravity is drawing us closer. Velocity is
increasing. Velocity still increasing. Now at two hundred and nineteen
metres per second. Starboard aft thruster. You have used the asteroid's
gravitational pull as a slingshot. Excellent. <br>
