Brent Spiner) <br>
RIKER: You're absolutely right, Doctor. Right now, I can't imagine ever
hurting anybody. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: How do you feel about that person you used to be? <br>
RIKER: I feel terrible. But thanks to you, I'm doing much better now.
And I'm confident that when I leave, I will be ready to take my place
in society again. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: When do you think that will be? <br>
RIKER: Well, now. Right away. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Why do you say that? <br>
RIKER: You said that when I was able to accept what I'd done and I
understood the consequences of my actions, that I would be free to go. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Free to go? You mean you don't think you should stand
trial for what you've did? <br>
RIKER: No, I'm looking forward to proving my innocence. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: I thought you said you accepted what you'd done. <br>
RIKER: That's, that's not what I meant. I was sick when it happened. I
wasn't responsible for what I did. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: How do I know you're not just telling me what I want to
hear? Perhaps we should continue this discussion next week. <br>
RIKER: No. I want to talk about this now. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: You're starting to sound angry again. Maybe you need
another treatment. <br>
RIKER: What I need is to get out of this cell. I've been locked in here
for days. You've controlled my every move. You've told me what to eat,
and what to think, and what to say, and when I show a glimmer of
independent thought you strap me down, you inject me with drugs. You
call it a treatment. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: You're becoming agitated. <br>
RIKER: You bet I'm agitated. I may be surrounded by insanity, but I'm
not insane. And there isn't any. There isn't. There's nothing. (breaks
into a grin) 'm sorry. Could we go back to 'you're becoming agitated'? <br>
(and now we discover that they're rehearsing a play, and the Doctor is
really
Data) <br>
CRUSHER: No. Why don't we take a break for tonight? I think we've made
a lot of progress. <br>
RIKER: I'm still not comfortable with that final speech. <br>
CRUSHER: There's such a thing as over-rehearsing, Will. You're going to
be fine. <br>
RIKER: Maybe I'm just not right for this part. <br>
DATA: Most humanoids have the potential to be irrational. Perhaps you
should attempt to access that part of your psyche. <br>
CRUSHER: Thank you, Data. Your character feels at odds with everyone,
as if the world's against him. <br>
RIKER: Like my first year at the Academy. <br>
CRUSHER: Yes, that's what your character is going through. But I want
you, Will Riker, to relax. <br>
RIKER: I'll do my best. <br>
CRUSHER: It'll be wonderful. You're going to knock 'em dead. <br>
RIKER: Right. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Tilonus Four? Didn't their government just
collapse? <br>
PICARD: It's in a state of total anarchy. When the Prime Minister was
assassinated, a Federation research team was on the planet. It's
believed that they were forced into hiding. Your mission will be to
locate and to evacuate them. <br>
RIKER: Can't they go to local authorities? <br>
PICARD: There are no local authorities. The government is splintered.
It seems that there are various factions vying for power. They're
desperate for weapons or technology of any kind. Apparently, some of
the factions have resorted to torture to gather their information.
Well, a Starfleet research team would be a prime target. <br>
RIKER: Then I'll have to go down there alone, undercover. <br>
PICARD: Agreed. Mister Worf is ready to give you a detailed briefing on
Tilonian culture. <br>
RIKER: Well, I guess I'll have to back out of Beverly's play after all.
<br>
PICARD: Oh no, no, there'll be plenty of time for that. We don't
arriving at Tilonus for another five days. And besides, if you back
out, she'll come after me to play the part.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(a map is on the wall monitor) <br>
WORF: This is the last known location of the research team. They had
occupied a small building in the south-west quarter of the city. You
will begin your search there. <br>
RIKER: The south-west quarter covers over two hundred square
kilometres. That's a lot of land for one man to cover. I guess I'd
better pack an extra pair of boots. <br>
WORF: This apparel will allow you to pass as a common merchant. This
Tilonian pendant is equipped with a communicator circuit. <br>
RIKER: It doesn't really match the outfit. <br>
WORF: I suggest you pay closer attention, Commander. Your life will be
at stake. Do you understand what I am saying? <br>
RIKER: Of course I do. <br>
WORF: Because you will be posing as a merchant, you will need to know
how to use the nisroh for the traditional bartering ceremony. <br>
(it is, of course, a dagger) <br>
WORF: You will be judged on your prowess with the blade. <br>
(Worf demonstrates, cutting Riker on the right temple) <br>
WORF: I am sorry, Commander! I did not intend <br>
RIKER: It's okay. I guess I really wasn't paying attention. I'd better
go to Sickbay. We'll continue this later.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: Boy, you will do anything to get out of
doing this play, but you're going to have to do something better than
this. <br>
RIKER: The play's not till tomorrow night. I've still got twenty four
hours. <br>
(she removes the cut) <br>
CRUSHER: Don't get any ideas. I will see you on stage at eighteen
hundred hours. <br>
RIKER: Right. That still hurts. <br>
CRUSHER: There was no damage to the nerves so you shouldn't be feeling
any pain. <br>
RIKER: Probably just a symptom of stage fright. <br>
(La Forge and a college bring in a badly burned engineer) <br>
CREWMAN: It hurts! <br>
LAFORGE: He was working on a conduit on deck thirty nine. A plasma
torch blew up in his hands. <br>
CREWMAN: It hurts! Please! <br>
CRUSHER: Hypospray. <br>
MEDIC: Yes, Doctor. <br>
(this dialogue gets very faint as we concentrate on Riker and the eyes
of the injured man) <br>
CRUSHER: Get me twenty cc's of opporozine. Treat the surface burns with
the anabolic stabiliser. <br>
MEDIC: Yes, Doctor. <br>
NURSE: Should we get a stasis unit? <br>
CRUSHER: Have one standing by just in case. Get me an epidermal sample.
Begin dermal regeneration. Have tissue regrowth standing by. I want him
sedated. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: I've been on a lot of missions, seen a lot
of people injured, but I've never been affected by anything like this.
He was looking right at me. <br>
TROI: And that was disturbing to you. <br>
RIKER: It was as if he was blaming me for something. This wasn't the
only incident. The last several days, I've felt like everybody's
staring at me or talking about me. It's as if I was in Frame of Mind. <br>
TROI: Frame of Mind? <br>
RIKER: Beverly's play. Ever since I began rehearsing for the role, I've
been uneasy and restless. <br>
TROI: You're probably drawing on feelings that you're not used to
expressing. <br>
RIKER: Right. The play is full of disturbing images. People losing
their minds, being tortured by doctors. I can't get it out of my mind. <br>
TROI: Sometimes it's healthy to explore the darker sides of the psyche.
Jung called it owning your own shadow. This could be a sign that you're
a real actor. This is becoming more than just a role to you. <br>
RIKER: Maybe you're right. <br>
TROI: Don't be afraid of your darker side. Have fun with it. <br>
(Riker rubs his sore temple and sees the crewman he bumped into at the
turbolift) <br>
RIKER: Who was that? You just missed him. Is there a new Lieutenant on
board? <br>
TROI: I'm not sure. Do you want me to check the personnel logs? <br>
RIKER: No, I'll check them tomorrow. I'm going to bed early. The
performance is tomorrow night. I want to be up for it. <br>
TROI: I'm looking forward to it. Break a leg. <br>

DATA: You're becoming agitated. <br>
RIKER: You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am
not insane. And nothing you or anyone else can say will change that.
And I won't let you or anyone else tell me that I am. You may be able
to destroy my mind, but you can't change the fact that I'm innocent. I
didn't kill that man! And that's what's driving you crazy. <br>
DATA: I can see we have a lot of work to do. <br>
(Data leaves stage left) <br>
RIKER: No matter you can say will the fact that I'm innocent! I'm not
crazy! I'm not crazy. (quietly) I'm not crazy. <br>

<br>
SYRUS: The ship again? <br>
(he's the same race as our spooky alien) <br>
RIKER: What's going on? <br>
SYRUS: I understand this must be disturbing for you, but try to relax.
Tell me, where were you a moment ago? <br>
RIKER: I was on the Enterprise in the middle of a play. But it was
here. It was not real, it was on a stage. <br>
SYRUS: I can assure you this is not a stage. Do you remember your name?
<br>
RIKER: I'm Commander. Commander. A second ago I knew who I was. I was
on the ship. I was in a play. And now I'm having trouble remembering
anything. <br>
SYRUS: That's good. You're starting to come out of your delusional
state. <br>
RIKER: Delusional? It was not a delusion. I was there. <br>
SYRUS: We discussed this. Do you remember, we contacted Starfleet and
asked them about you? <br>
RIKER: No. <br>
SYRUS: We spoke with Admiral Budrow. <br>
RIKER: Starbase twenty nine. He had never heard of me, and they had no
officer that fit my description. <br>
SYRUS: That's right. Now, I want you to focus on who I am. Do you
remember me? <br>
RIKER: I don't know. <br>
SYRUS: I'm Doctor Syrus. Do you remember anything about where you are
now? <br>
RIKER: My head hurts. Somebody hit me. <br>
SYRUS: You tried to escape. You struggled with one of the attendants
and hit your head on a door. Do you remember that? <br>
RIKER: Yes. I remember that now. But I thought it was a Klingon who had
cut me with a knife. <br>
SYRUS: That's called transposition. You're projecting elements from
your delusions onto events that really happened. But that's good. There
was a time when you couldn't break away from your starship fantasy at
all. <br>
RIKER: Now, if what you say is true, where am I? <br>
SYRUS: You're in Ward forty seven of the Tilonus Institute for Mental
Disorders. <br>
RIKER: Why am I here? <br>
SYRUS: We'll talk more later. You don't have to remember everything
today. You're making excellent progress. <br>
(Syrus leaves) <br>
RIKER: Wait. <br>
(Riker explores his surprisingly spacious cell, with a mirror on the
wall) <br>
MAVEK [OC]: Good afternoon. I've got some good news for you. Doctor
Syrus suggested that you might enjoy a couple of hours in the common
area today. Well? <br>
RIKER: I guess so. <br>
(the attendant and an armed guard enter) <br>
MAVEK: I hope you're hungry. They're serving spiny lobe-fish today. <br>

JAYA: I hear you're a Starfleet officer. I'm Commander Bloom from the
Yorktown. There are at least a dozen of us here, maybe more. We were
kidnapped, brought here against our will. Sanders was on the Yosemite.
They did something to his mind. I think they're trying to get
neurochemicals from our brains. Stafko was with me on the Yorktown. I
don't know what they did to him. We're going to get out of here. I've
made a communicator. <br>
RIKER: You have? <br>
JAYA: Yes. There are three starships in orbit. They're going to beam us
out of here any day now. I'll tell them to get you out, too. (into
spoon) Lieutenant Bloom to Yorktown. Come in, Yorktown. I've made
contact with another officer. <br>
MAVEK: Talking to your Starship again, Jaya? <br>

RIKER: Your name is Mavek. <br>
MAVEK: That's right. Not bad for a crazy man. <br>
RIKER: I am beginning to remember certain things. Why am I here? <br>
MAVEK: I remember when they brought you in. You were struggling,
screaming. We could barely hold you down. In fact, just getting the
blood off your hands took over an hour. <br>
RIKER: Blood? <br>
MAVEK: On your hands, clothes. You didn't just kill that man, you
mutilated him. <br>
RIKER: What are you talking about? I didn't kill anybody. <br>
MAVEK: I'm afraid you did. You stabbed him. They found you near the
body, the knife in your hand. <br>
RIKER: No. It's not true. <br>
MAVEK: Yes it is. And if you get out of here, you're going to stand
trial. <br>
RIKER: You're lying! <br>
MAVEK: I imagine the punishment will be quite severe, considering you
stabbed him nine times. <br>

Everyone thought that I was insane, that I'd actually killed someone.
But it was all real. <br>
CRUSHER: Deanna mentioned that you went to bed early because you were
feeling a little anxious about the play, but I had no idea. You said
that in your dream, we performed the play. How'd it go? <br>

delusion? <br>
RIKER: All I know is when I go back to the ship, reality breaks apart.
Nothing makes sense. And then when it's over, it fades away like a
dream. But when I'm in the hospital, everything here seems real and I
remember everything that happens here. <br>

RIKER: Maybe I did kill someone. I don't know. But I want to know how. <br>

with the hospital Administrator. He told me there are certain legal
questions that have to be resolved relatively soon. <br>

SYRUS: Meaning we can't keep you here much longer. We're the only
mental health facility on Tilonus Four. We have many people who need
our help. I don't want to put any undue stress on you but we have to
settle this case one way or another within the next few days. <br>
RIKER: What does that mean? <br>
SYRUS: You're facing a choice. We can try to help you remember what
happened using Reflection therapy. If it's successful, you would be fit
to stand trial. <br>
RIKER: Reflection therapy? <br>
SYRUS: It's a way for you to interact with the various facets of your
personality. We scan the regions of your brain that control emotions
and memory, and then project them holographically. <br>
RIKER: And what is the second option? <br>
SYRUS: A complete synaptic reconstruction of your cerebral cortex. <br>
RIKER: Surgery. <br>
SYRUS: We would neutralise the synaptic pathways responsible for your
mental instability. <br>
RIKER: It doesn't sound like you care for that option. <br>
SYRUS: I don't. The procedure is irreversible. You'd be left with a
completely altered personality. The person you are now would cease to
exist. <br>
RIKER: Option one is beginning to sound better. <br>
SYRUS: I agree. <br>
RIKER: Reflection therapy, then. When do we begin? <br>
SYRUS: This afternoon, if you're ready. I want you to understand that
this isn't going to be easy. You'll be interacting with aspects of your
psyche you've never dealt with before, and you may be disturbed by what
they have to say.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(a columnar device has been brought into the cell) <br>
SYRUS: Close your eyes. Try to relax. Clear your mind. <br>
(the device sends out a beam which scans Riker's face) <br>
SYRUS: Now, think back to before you came to the hospital. But don't
try to remember specific incidents. Concentrate on how you felt. <br>
RIKER: I was afraid. <br>
(a second beam projects an image) <br>
TROI: Terrified. <br>
RIKER: She was on the ship with me. <br>
SYRUS: That's because she represents an aspect of your personality, and
there are many parts of you that still believe you're on that starship.
<br>
RIKER: Why her? <br>
SYRUS: I asked you to get in touch with your feelings, and this is the
part of you that responded. Talk to her about how you felt before you
came here. <br>
RIKER: You said I was terrified. Of what? <br>
TROI: I was in a dark place. Cold. Frightened. Someone was there. <br>
RIKER: Who? <br>
TROI: I felt threatened by them. Trapped <br>
SYRUS: You're doing very well. Now let's try to find out how you
responded to these feelings. Try to focus on your actions. You felt
trapped. What did you do? <br>
WORF: I was angry. They were attacking me. I fought back. <br>
TROI: I felt pain. <br>
WORF: I was injured. <br>
TROI: I began to panic. <br>
WORF: There was a struggle and I <br>
RIKER: You what? What happened? <br>
SYRUS: Try to associate your actions and emotions with logical
thoughts. What do you think caused you to act and feel this way? <br>
PICARD: It was cold and dark because I was outdoors at night. I was in
a narrow place. I was walking through an alley. <br>
TROI: I felt threatened. <br>
WORF: I was being watched. <br>
PICARD: Someone must have followed me into the alley. That's why I
started to walk faster. Someone grabbed me from behind. <br>
TROI: I panicked. <br>
WORF: I tried to fight them off. <br>
RIKER: How many of them were there? <br>
PICARD: Three. Humanoid. I only saw the face of one of them. <br>
RIKER: What did he look like? <br>
(and the spooky alien is sitting next to Riker) <br>
RIKER: I saw him on the ship too. I also saw him here in the hospital,
but I don't know who he is. <br>
SYRUS: That's Mister Suna, the hospital Administrator. You met him when
you first arrived here. <br>
RIKER: What part of me does he represent? <br>
SYRUS: I don't know. <br>
TROI: Don't believe this, Will. None of it's real. You're still with us
on the Enterprise. <br>
RIKER: Doctor? <br>
PICARD: We're your colleagues. You can trust us. Everything will be all
right <br>
SYRUS: Do you have anything to say to them? <br>
RIKER: You're all delusions. <br>
WORF: Do not listen to him, Commander. He is trying to trick you. You
are in danger here. Let us help you. <br>
TROI: Listen to me, Will. In all the years we've known each other, have
I ever lied to you? <br>
RIKER: No, please. Leave me alone! <br>
PICARD: Will, please. <br>
RIKER: No! <br>
(the device removes the images) <br>
SYRUS: You've taken a big step today. You've finally turned your back
on those delusions and all that they represent to you. We'll continue
later.

CRUSHER: Commander, do you know who I am? Do you know where you are? If
you can't answer, just listen. You were on an undercover mission to
Tilonus Four. Something happened. We were told that you killed
somebody, but we do not believe it's true. We're being blocked at every
turn. The hospital Administrator denies you're here at all. We're
beginning to think that there's some kind of a conspiracy going on. I

during the mission to Tilonus Four. You were put into a psychiatric
hospital. <br>
RIKER: It's still bleeding. <br>
CRUSHER: It's minor. Don't worry about it. <br>
WORF: We have been checking on the hospital Administrator. <br>
RIKER: Mister Suna. <br>
PICARD: It appears that he's involved with one of the rival factions.
We believe that he is responsible for what happened to you. <br>
RIKER: It still hurts. It's bleeding again. Why? You just healed it. <br>
CRUSHER: Will, try to calm down. <br>

PICARD: What are you doing, Will? <br>
RIKER: If I'm right, you're not really here. This isn't a real phaser.
It's all a fantasy, and I'm going to end it, no matter what it takes. <br>
PICARD: But what if it isn't a fantasy? Are you willing to take that
chance? <br>

reconstruction. <br>
RIKER: I still have a phaser. Why do I still have a phaser? <br>
SUNA: It's not a phaser, it's a knife. You stole it from one of the
food trays. Give it to me. We don't want you to hurt yourself. <br>

SUNA: It's very complicated. I'll answer all of your questions, but
first I want you to put that down. <br>
RIKER: No. If this is a real phaser, then I was on the Enterprise. But
I fired it on myself, so I should be dead. None of this is real. I'm
setting this to level sixteen, wide field. That should destroy half of
this building. Unless, of course, this isn't a real phaser. <br>

get off one of them off me but I think they injected me with some sort

back at the hospital. I kept shifting from place to place. I couldn't
tell what was real. <br>

resist the neurosomatic process. Your unconscious fastened on to
elements of your real life in an attempt to keep you grounded, to keep
you sane. <br>
