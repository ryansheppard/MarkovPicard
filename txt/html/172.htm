Captain's log, stardate 43930.7. The Enterprise has been in attendance
at the biennial Trade Agreements Conference on Betazed. For the first
time, the Ferengi are present, and I have reluctantly consented to
their boarding the Enterprise for the closing reception.

chess against a Ferengi) <br>
RIKER: Check and mate. <br>
WESLEY: Perfect. The queen's gambit finished off with the Aldabren
Exchange. <br>
NIBOR: That is unfair. I couldn't concentrate with all that noise. <br>
WESLEY: Noise? It's Algolian ceremonial rhythms. <br>
PICARD: A toast to the success of the trade conference, Reittan. I must
admit, I had some doubts when you invited the Ferengi. <br>
GRAX: They made a profit and behaved themselves. What more could one
ask? Still, they trouble me. We Betazeds are uncomfortable with species
like the Ferengi whose minds we can't read. <br>
DATA: Perhaps your telepathic abilities are ineffective owing to the
anomalous construction of the Ferengi brain, which is composed of four
different <br>
PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. It was thoughtful of you to invite
Lwaxana Troi to be part of the Betazed delegation. <br>
GRAX: Yes, Lwaxana and I go way back. Her first husband and I were old
friends, and I've known Deanna since she was a child. <br>
PICARD: I'm sure Counsellor Troi appreciates the opportunity to spend
time with her mother. <br>
LWAXANA [telepath]: (whilst eating) Little One, you could at least
pretend you're happy to see me. <br>
TROI: Mother, we're among non-telepaths. It's impolite not to speak
aloud. <br>
LWAXANA [telepath]: You mean talk with my mouth full? Deanna, please! <br>
LWAXANA: All right, you want me to say something aloud? Have you
considered if you had stayed on Betazed, you might have been a happier
person. <br>
TROI: Let's not guess what might have been. I love my work aboard the
Enterprise. <br>
LWAXANA: Yes, of course you do, but its all business and no play.
You've got to enjoy life, relax, like I do. Find yourself the right
man, think of your future. Think of my future. <br>
RIKER: Lwaxana, Deanna. Anything I can do for you? <br>
TROI: (gets up) Could I? <br>
(Riker and Troi leave Lwaxana and go to sit at the bar) <br>
FAREK: She's as repulsive as the rest of them. <br>
(Ethan Phillips, who will eventually be Neelix, is under those ears) <br>
TOG: Repulsive? I find her exotic. And what an advantage her telepathy
would be in our negotiations. <br>
FAREK: To read our competitors' minds? Yes, that would be valuable. But
she'd never agree to use her powers to help us. <br>
TOG: I'm not so sure. <br>
(He goes over and introduces himself) <br>
TOG: Lwaxana Troi of Betazed, I believe. I am DaiMon Tog of the Ferengi
vessel Krayton. May I join you? <br>
LWAXANA: I was just going to see Captain Picard. Excuse me. <br>
(Lwaxana hurries away) <br>
LWAXANA: Oh, Jean-Luc! Jean-Luc! Come have a drink with me. Tell me
what you've been up to. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps later, Lwaxana. Mister Data and I were just about to
show Reittan Grax the er, the er, the new door mechanisms on the aft
turbolifts. If you'll excuse us? <br>
TOG: Lwaxana Troi. I desire you. <br>
LWAXANA: What? <br>
TOG: You see, your Betazoid skills would be very useful to me, and I
find you very attractive. I am willing to pay handsomely for you. <br>
LWAXANA: I don't believe this. <br>
TOG: You must be aware that every female has her price. <br>
LWAXANA: Let's get one thing straight, little man. I am not for sale.
And if, by some chance I were to become available, I would rather eat
Orion wing-slugs than deal with a toad-faced troll like you! So go away
and find someone else to become your property. <br>
(She storms out) <br>
TOG: As you wish. <br>
FAREK: Now that you've totally humiliated us, may we return to our

TOG: She is exhilarating, isn't she? Now I want her more than ever.
Lwaxana Troi, you will be mine.

centre myself. Can you imagine that dreadful little creature talking to
me like that? Doesn't he realise that I am a daughter of the Fifth
House of Betazed. Holder of the Sacred Chalice of Rixx? <br>
TROI: The Sacred Chalice of Rixx is an old clay pot with mold growing
inside it. <br>
LWAXANA: Perhaps one day when you're older and wiser, you'll
understand. Come on, sit down. Talk to me. We spend so little time
together. <br>
TROI: That's true. I'm sorry, and I didn't mean to get so upset with
you at the reception. <br>
LWAXANA: Deanna, try to understand. You're all I have. My only concern
is for your happiness. <br>
TROI: I am happy. Why can't you believe that? <br>
LWAXANA: I wish I could, but how much happiness is there in always
being there for someone else, and never being there for yourself? <br>
TROI: I get a great deal of satisfaction out of my work. <br>
LWAXANA: I'm sure you do. I'm sure it's very rewarding in its way. What
about a family? <br>
TROI: This is my family. My friends here on the Enterprise. <br>
LWAXANA: All right. In case I have to spell it out for you, I'm talking
about finding a husband, having a child. That's what made me happy. At
least until now. <br>
TROI: Mother, look. Perhaps some day I will marry. But you've got to
let me make my own choices, live my own life, and not the life you
would choose for me. <br>
LWAXANA: You had your chance with Commander Riker. Look how you ruined
that. <br>
TROI: I did not ruin anything. We've became very good friends. <br>
LWAXANA: Well, all the better. You certainly wouldn't want to marry an
enemy. I see we can't talk about this. Very well, have it your way,
Little One. <br>
TROI: Little One? You called me that when I was five. Now stop
demeaning me and address me as an adult!

counters boosted efficiency by eleven percent. Of course, Commander La
Forge and Commander Data did most of the work. <br>
LAFORGE: Not so fast, Wesley. Pre-processing the data with an optical
chip was your idea. <br>
DATA: That is correct, sir. Although Commander La Forge and I designed
the chip, Mister Crusher derived the equation governing its operation. <br>
RIKER: The point is, you've completed the upgrade well ahead of
schedule. Very impressive. <br>
PICARD: Indeed. Fine work. We shall miss you, Mister Crusher. As you've
guessed, final entrance examination scores from Starfleet Academy have
arrived. Congratulations. As soon as you have completed the oral exam,
you'll be formally admitted. <br>
RIKER: We'll have you back at Betazed in plenty of time to meet up with
the Academy transport ship. <br>
WESLEY: Thank you, sir. <br>
PICARD: That'll be all. Number One, a moment. <br>
(Wesley and Geordi leave) <br>
RIKER: Yes, Captain? <br>
PICARD: You'll agree that this is a fairly routine mapping mission? <br>

shake it) <br>
TROI: It's lovely. I remember that sound, and all the good times we
had. <br>
RIKER: I remember a certain junior officer meeting a very serious
psychologist. The best part about being assigned to Betazed. <br>
(as they kiss, they don't notice the flamboyantly dressed woman, and a
tall man carrying picnic baskets) <br>
LWAXANA: Oh, this is the perfect spot. Put the food down over there,
Mister Homn. Isn't it a beautiful day for a picnic? They'll join us in
a minute. No, no, no, no. Here, put the food over there. No, you can go
back <br>
TROI: Mother, how did you know about this place? <br>
LWAXANA: Your father used to bring me here. Sit down. <br>
RIKER: And you even brought provisions. Very thoughtful. <br>
LWAXANA: Here, Will, Deanna. Try an oskoid. They're delicious. That sap
running through the veins helps keep it warm. <br>
RIKER: Very tasty. So tell us, Lwaxana. The last time we met, you were
looking for a husband. Did you have any luck? <br>
LWAXANA: Alas, no, but what happens to me isn't important. I'm much
more concerned about other people getting on with their lives. <br>
TROI: Mother. <br>
LWAXANA: Mister Homn, I noticed some uttaberries back along the path.
Pick some. <br>
(Homn dutifully leaves them) <br>
LWAXANA: Well, Mister Homn and I could go back home if you two would
like to be alone. It's such a romantic setting. <br>
TROI: Mother, stop it. <br>
LWAXANA: Darling, you have been so excitable lately. Have you ever
thought of a leave of absence? I could talk to Jean-Luc. <br>
RIKER: Try the oskoid. Very different. <br>
(A Ferengi beams in) <br>
RIKER: What the? <br>
TOG: For one whose beauty surpasses even these pericules. <br>
RIKER: DaiMon Tog, I thought the Krayton left orbit hours ago. <br>
TOG: It did. But when I tried to get the image of Lwaxana Troi out of
my mind, I could not succeed. <br>
LWAXANA: This is ludicrous. You mean you came all the way back to
Betazed for me? <br>
TOG: Why continue to search for perfection once you have found it? <br>
TROI: I don't believe this. <br>
LWAXANA: Look, Demon Tog, or whatever you call yourself, I am the
Daughter of the Fifth House, Holder of the Sacred Chalice of Rixx, heir
to the Holy Rings of Betazed. And unless you want to create an
interstellar incident, you had better beam back to your ship. <br>

RIKER: From the smell of things, I'd say we're aboard a Ferengi vessel.
<br>
LWAXANA: The Ferengi can't do that. You're Starfleet officers. <br>

Betazoid females. Now, Lwaxana, I have a business proposition for you. <br>

LWAXANA: Oh please, don't listen to him. Don't. No, he's misunderstood
me. <br>
FAREK: No, Tog. You have misunderstood. You have been tricked by a sly
female who finds you repulsive. <br>
TOG: She was only trying to serve me a drink. <br>
FAREK: You almost gave her complete access to the ship's computer. A
security breach severe enough to cost you your command.! It's time you
took my advice. Let me study her. <br>
TOG: Study her? Your mind probes could kill her. <br>
FAREK: You brought her aboard for her telepathic powers. If I can
determine what neural configuration gives her those powers, I may be
able to duplicate them. We could still profit from this. <br>
TOG: I don't know. <br>
FAREK: A true DaiMon would not be blinded by lust. Give her to me, or I
may be forced to report your transgressions. <br>
TOG: Very well. Take her.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Lots of people with tricorders taking scans) <br>
WORF: When you have finished here, survey in that direction. <br>
CREWWOMAN: Aye, sir. <br>
GRAX: I wish I had some answers for you, Lieutenant Worf. <br>
WORF: Mister Homn was no help? <br>
GRAX: None. He last saw them as he was leaving this clearing. When he
returned, all three of them were gone. <br>

species is Zan Periculi. It is not indigenous to Betazed, but to Lappa
Four. A Ferengi world.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Now we now have a reasonable hypothesis as
to whom. <br>
WORF: The difficult question is where. <br>
LAFORGE: The Ferengi ship is almost as fast as the Enterprise. She
could be anywhere by now. <br>
PICARD: Commander Riker will assume that we'll be searching for them.
He'll find some way to send us a message. <br>
Mister Worf, I want continual monitoring of Ferengi subspace
frequencies. Mister La Forge, can you extend our sensor range? <br>
LAFORGE: If I narrow the band and tie in long range sensors to the
subspace scanners, I can boost the gain. <br>
PICARD: Make it so. <br>
DATA: Do you wish to leave orbit, sir? <br>
PICARD: Not until we have someplace to go.

use. Without Tog's security code, I can't get near their communication
system. <br>
TROI: We're running out of time. Farek's about to begin the neural scan
on Mother. <br>
RIKER: Maybe I'm going about this in the wrong way. If I pick a minor
subsystem, something non-essential. Like this. Warp field phase
adjustment. All this does is suppress the subspace interference
generated by the warp engines. <br>
TROI: Meaning what? <br>
RIKER: Meaning if I set up a simple oscillation, I can send out a
signal. The trick is to create a message that the Enterprise will
understand but that the Ferengi will think is just normal subspace
static. What's wrong? <br>
(Lwaxana is being tortured by the Ferengi mind probe. It hurts, a lot) <br>

PICARD: Can you locate the Krayton? <br>
DATA: Ferengi transmissions are routinely scrambled and encoded, sir.
Without breaking the code, we will be unable to identify any specific
Ferengi vessel. <br>
LAFORGE: Ferengi codes are damn near impossible to break. <br>
PICARD: Gentlemen, I have the utmost confidence in your ability to
perform the impossible. <br>

WESLEY: We've been scanning Ferengi transmissions, trying to find the

PICARD: Wesley.&nbsp;<br>
WESLEY: Captain, I think there's a pattern to the subspace interference
I heard on one of the Ferengi messages. <br>
PICARD: Wesley, unless you leave immediately, you're going to miss the
Bradbury. <br>
WESLEY: The interference itself could be a message. If I could just
hear a replay of the subspace scans. <br>
PICARD: Signal the Bradbury they may leave. Play back the Ferengi
transmissions. <br>
WESLEY: Wait. Repeat that one. Put it on a continuous replay. Hear that
popping noise? Data, can you filter out everything but that sound? <br>
LAFORGE: That's Cochrane distortion. A fluctuation in the phase of the
subspace field. All warp engines generate that kind of interference. <br>
WESLEY: But listen to the pattern. It's the Algolian ceremonial rhythm
that the musician played at the reception. <br>
DATA: Mister Crusher is correct, sir. There is a temporal correlation. <br>
PICARD: Then it is a signal from Commander Riker. Ingenious. He
selected a signal we'd recognise but one the Ferengi would dismiss as
static. <br>
WORF: Signal source located, Captain. <br>
