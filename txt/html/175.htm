have engaged the Borg. <br>
SHELBY: Data, fluctuate phaser resonance frequencies. Random settings.
Keep them changing. Don't give them time to adapt. <br>
HANSON [on monitor]: We're coming with every available starship to
assist, Captain, but the closest help is six days away. <br>
SHELBY: All you know how to do is play it safe. If you can't make the
big decisions, Commander, I suggest you make room for someone who can.<br>
(The Borg kidnap Picard) <br>
LAFORGE: If we can generate a concentrated burst of power at that same
frequency distribution. <br>
RIKER: How do we do that? <br>
WESLEY: The main deflector dish. <br>
SHELBY: Shelby to Enterprise. We've found the Captain's uniform and his
communicator. <br>
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc! <br>
DATA: We were unable to retrieve him, sir. Sir, The Captain has been
altered by the Borg. <br>
CRUSHER: Will, he's alive. If we could get him back to the ship, I
might be able to restore <br>
RIKER: This is our only chance to destroy them. If they get back into
warp, our weapon is useless. <br>
PICARD [on viewscreen]: I am Locutus of Borg. From this time forward,
you will service us.<br>
RIKER: Mister Worf? Fire. <br>

of action. Your resistance is hopeless, Number One.

HANSON [on monitor]: Well, we'll miss you at the party.<br>
RIKER: The Enterprise'll be there, sir. Maybe a little late, but we'll
be there, sir. <br>
HANSON [on monitor]: Your engagements have given us valuable time.
We've mobilised a fleet of forty starships at Wolf three five nine, and
that's just for starters. The Klingons are sending warships. Hell,
we've even thought about opening communications with the Romulans. <br>
SHELBY: You realise, Admiral, that with the assistance of Captain
Picard, the Borg will be prepared for your defences.<br>
HANSON [on monitor]: Lieutenant a few years ago, I watched a freshman
cadet pass four upper classman on the last hill of the forty kilometre
run on Danula Two. The damndest thing I ever saw. The only freshman to
ever win the Academy marathon. I made it my business to get to know
that young fellow. I got to know him very, very well. And I'll tell you
something. I never met anyone with more drive, determination or more
courage than Jean-Luc Picard. There is no way in hell that he would
assist the Borg. I want that clear.<br>
SHELBY: Of course, Admiral. <br>
HANSON [on monitor]: He is a casualty of war.<br>
CRUSHER: Then we have abandoned all hope of recovering him.<br>
HANSON [on monitor]: In less than twenty four hours, this armada's
going to hit that Borg vessel with everything we can muster. Either
they survive or we do. As for Picard. A great man has been lost. Your
Captain. My friend. Commander Riker, I hereby promote you to the field
commission of Captain. The Enterprise is your ship now.
Congratulations. I wish the circumstances were different.<br>
RIKER: Likewise. Good luck, Admiral.<br>
HANSON [on monitor]: To us all.

WORF: That would be a great advantage.<br>
RIKER: We should also see if there's some way that we can neutralise
their forcefields. We've got to let them know that we can adapt too,
Mister Worf. We're no longer just fighting the Borg, we're fighting the
life experience they've stolen from Captain Picard. Now how the hell do
we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves?<br>

SHELBY: Checking. Sensors are fine. No. Aft shields have completely
failed. Damn it. Auxiliary generators are out again. <br>
LAFORGE: Just the man I need. We're having some problems with the aft
shields. Generators going on and offline. I could really use your help,
Worf <br>
RIKER: How soon do we get underway, Geordi?<br>
LAFORGE: Still a couple hours. Commander Shelby can fill you in. <br>
SHELBY: The main navigational deflector is functional again. Sherbourne
and Barclay are running through the final testing sequence now. <br>
RIKER: The warp reactor core?<br>
SHELBY: Reconstruction is proceeding normally. It's slow work. If we
can nail down this shield generator problem, I agree with La Forge. We
should be at

RIKER: Commander, we don't have to like each other to work well
together. As a fact of fact, I'd like you to continue to keep me on my
toes.<br>
SHELBY: Some might define that as the role of a first officer.<br>
RIKER: Damn, you are ambitious, aren't you, Shelby. <br>
SHELBY: Captain Riker, based on our past relationship, there's no
reason for me to expect to become your first officer except you need
me. I know how to get things done, and I have the expertise in the
Borg. <br>
RIKER: And you have a lot to learn, Commander.<br>
SHELBY: Yes, sir.<br>
RIKER: Almost as much as I had to learn when I came aboard as Captain
Picard's first officer. A fact he reminded me of when I commented on
what a pain in the neck you are.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, everyone in this room
shares my respect for your service to this ship. But right now, I need
your experience at tactical. Commander Data, I realise your very nature
omits ambition. Nevertheless, I want you to know I seriously considered
you first officer. <br>
DATA: Thank you, sir. <br>
RIKER: But this is not the time for change. I need you all where you
are, where Captain Picard always relied on you. I have been,
reluctantly, forced to conclude that Commander Shelby, our expert on
the Borg, is an ideal choice at this time for first officer. Based on
our latest communication, we can assume that the Borg survived the
fleet's attack. Your thoughts on our next encounter? <br>
SHELBY: What about the heavy graviton beam we were talking about?<br>
LAFORGE: I've gone over it four times. The local field distortion just
wouldn't be strong enough to incapacitate them. <br>
DATA: Doctor Crusher and I have been working on an interesting premise.
<br>
CRUSHER: With our recent experience in nanotechnology, we might be able
to introduce a destructive breed of nanites into the Borg. <br>
SHELBY: Nanites?<br>
DATA: Robots small enough to enter living cells.<br>
RIKER: How long would it take to execute that? <br>
CRUSHER: That's the problem. Two to three weeks.<br>
TROI: In two or three weeks, nanites may be all that's left of the
Federation.<br>
WORF: We have the new phaser adapters. <br>
LAFORGE: maybe in concert with photon torpedoes we can slow them down. <br>
RIKER: I'm sure Captain Picard would have something meaningful and
inspirational to say right now. To tell you the truth, I wish he were
here, because I'd like to hear it too. I know how difficult this
transition has been for all of you. I can take over for him, but I
could never replace Captain Picard. Nor would I ever try. Whatever the
outcome, I'm sure our efforts in the coming battle will justify his
faith in all of us. Dismissed.

one of us needed to. I guess I'm just used to having the Captain's ear.
<br>

RIKER: What's on your mind?<br>
GUINAN: I've heard a lot of people talking down in Ten Forward. They
expect to be dead in the next day or so. They trust you. They like you.
But they don't believe anyone can save them.<br>
RIKER: I'm not sure anyone can.<br>
GUINAN: When a man is convinced he's going to die tomorrow, he'll
probably find a way to make it happen. The only one who can turn is
around is you. <br>
RIKER: I'll do the best I can.<br>
GUINAN: You're going have to do something you don't want to do. You
have to let go of Picard.<br>
RIKER: Maybe you haven't heard. I tried to kill him yesterday.<br>
GUINAN: You tried to kill whatever that is on the Borg ship. Not
Picard. Picard is still here with us in this room. If he had died, it
would be easier. But he didn't They took him from us a piece at a time.
Did he ever tell you why we're so close?<br>
RIKER: No.<br>
GUINAN: Well, then let me just our relationship is beyond friendship,
beyond family. And I will let him go. And you must do the same. There
can only be one Captain.<br>
RIKER: It's not that simple. This was his crew. He wrote the book on
this ship. <br>
GUINAN: And the Borg know everything he knows. It's time to throw that
book away. You must let him go, Riker. It's the only way to beat him.

DATA: Possibly. But as you may recall on several occasions, we have
witnessed the Borg removing key circuits from injured comrades, no
doubt separating them from the group consciousness.<br>

DATA: That is correct, sir.<br>
CRUSHER: Cutting the link to Locutus might be fatal to the Captain.<br>
RIKER: We have to find a way to reach him. We must know what he knows <br>
CRUSHER: Without these interactive signals, it would only be a matter
of microsurgery. I could do it. But as long as those Borg implants are
functioning, there's no way I can separate the man from the machine.<br>

suggest you closely observe Captain Picard's lifesigns, while at each
