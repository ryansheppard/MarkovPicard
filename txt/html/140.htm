Captain's log, Stardate 42686.4. We are en route to Starbase Montgomery
for engineering consultations prompted by minor readout anomalies.

RIKER: What if you're wrong? Sorry. But what if it is more than a mere
discrepancy? <br>
LAFORGE: Then I'd say we have a problem. <br>
PICARD: Agreed. We'll have Starbase Montgomery give us an independent
reading. <br>
DATA: Even if the molecular level controls have failed, we can still
recrystallise the dilithium without outside help. <br>
LAFORGE: Don't worry, Data. My ego isn't at stake here. <br>
DATA: Perhaps we can reprogram the system to correct the readout
variables <br>
PICARD: Well, that's certainly another option, but as we're stopping at
Starbase Montgomery anyway, we'll let them do the analysis. <br>
RIKER: I don't recall Starbase Montgomery on the mission itinerary <br>
PICARD: I think we could all use a twelve hour layover. Besides, I've
just received some personnel transfer directives. Priority matter, <br>
RIKER: Boarding or disembarking? <br>
WESLEY [OC]: Captain Picard. We're within hailing range of Starbase
Montgomery <br>
PICARD: Go to half impulse power. (to Riker) Will you join me in the
Observation lounge when you're done?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Captain? <br>
PICARD: Number One, I've just been recollecting the arrival of a new
First Officer on board the Enterprise, and a manual docking confidently
achieved. I may have been somewhat miserly in my congratulations then,
so let me make up for it now. The Captain of the Starship Ares is
retiring. Congratulations. You've been selected as his replacement. <br>
RIKER: The Ares. She's in Vega-Omicron sector. <br>
PICARD: And they have picked up indications of an intelligent life
form, though nothing confirmed. <br>
RIKER: Obviously, Starfleet will want to know more. <br>
PICARD: That's why they're asking for you. Not for your military
proficiency, but for your skill as an explorer and as a diplomat. <br>
RIKER: Vega-Omicron. It'll take months at high warp just to get there. <br>
PICARD: With no guarantee of finding anything when you arrive. Well,
you have twelve hours to think it over. And if it's not too premature,
congratulations, Captain.

WESLEY: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Starbase Montgomery is sending a civilian advisor on board to
brief you on the Ares's mission. <br>
RIKER: A personal briefing? <br>
PICARD: A strategic attaché with specialised knowledge in the frontier
regions. I think you'll find the briefing interesting. <br>
RIKER: I hope it's complete. Much of my decision will be based on it. <br>

RIKER: Dad. You're the civilian advisor? The strategic attaché? <br>
KYLE: I asked Captain Picard to keep it quiet. I didn't want you to
make you nervous or excited. <br>
RIKER: It's been fifteen years. Excitement is hardly the appropriate
emotion. <br>
KYLE: You've done well. First Officer on the Enterprise. Quite a
feather in your cap. <br>
RIKER: I've worked hard. <br>
KYLE: Of course. I'm proud of you, son. <br>
RIKER: If you'll excuse me, I've got my duties to attend to. When

surprised. <br>
WORF: So? <br>
WESLEY: Can you imagine if it was your father? <br>
WORF: I never knew my father. <br>
WESLEY: And I didn't have a father long enough to know him. <br>

WESLEY: He was really upset. I must've said something wrong. <br>
LAFORGE: Maybe Worf's not too thrilled with the idea of losing
Commander Riker to a new assignment. I know I'm not. <br>

really bothering him. <br>

WESLEY: Really? You try talking to Worf, Geordi. I'm telling you, he is
not normal for Worf. <br>

among all Klingons, but Worf has been unusually out of sorts. <br>
LAFORGE: Come on, he's never been much on charm. <br>
WESLEY: Well, whatever is troubling him, I think we should try to help.

Starfleet as a tactical advisor. <br>

with themselves. <br>
KYLE: Ouch. <br>
PULASKI: Face facts, Kyle. You're crusty. You have a reputation for
being hard as nails and getting the job done. Underneath it all, you're
not so bad. Some of us even love you. And then there's Will. <br>

looks perfectly normal to me. <br>
DATA: In solitude, there is nothing to trigger unusual behaviour. <br>
LAFORGE: Good point. Let's not tamper with the status quo. <br>
DATA: But that would defeat the opportunity for our behavioural
research. In all probability, he is simply lonely. We can relieve his
anxiety through socialisation. <br>
LAFORGE: Be my guest. <br>

DATA: Excuse me, Lieutenant. You seem to have lost the will to
communicate with others. You have friends here. We, we care about you.

WORF: With all due respect, be gone! Sir. <br>

LAFORGE: Really? How would you like them to give the transporter
operation a little once-over? <br>
O'BRIEN: No problem. We're totally ship-shape. <br>
LAFORGE: You're missing the point. It's just the idea that they even
suspect a malfunction. <br>
DATA: If I were not a consummate professional, and an android, I would
find this entire procedure insulting. <br>
LAFORGE: Thanks, Data. <br>
(Another part of Engineering, where Wesley is talking to Guy) <br>
WESLEY: Chief, will you be able to attend a little party for Lieutenant
Worf at seventeen hundred hours? <br>
O'BRIEN: A party for Worf? Sounds intriguing. I'd be delighted. <br>
WESLEY: It's a surprise. <br>
O'BRIEN: My lips are sealed.

RIKER: The feeling is mutual, Counsellor. <br>
TROI: I'm supposed to know how everyone feels but, I can't read you

RIKER: Perhaps your own feelings are getting in the way. <br>
TROI: My job is to help others sort out their emotions. My own feelings
are beside the point. <br>

LAFORGE: Cute bunch. <br>
WESLEY: And they use those? <br>
O'BRIEN: Those are Klingon painstiks. I once saw one of them used
against a two-ton Rectyne Monopod. Poor creature jumped five metres at
the slightest touch. It finally died from excessive cephalic pressures.

TROI: Klingon culture is not in your taste? <br>
PULASKI: I'm just glad that humans have progressed beyond the need for
barbaric display. <br>
TROI: Have they? Commander Riker and his father are in the gymnasium,
about to engage in barbarism of their own. <br>
PULASKI: Don't remind me. It's something of which I do not approve. <br>
TROI: In spite of human evolution, there are still some traits that are
endemic to gender. <br>
PULASKI: You think that they're going to knock each other's brains out

children, even into adulthood. And sons continue to chafe against what
they perceive as their fathers' expectations of them. <br>

martial arts. <br>
(They are wearing plastic suits of armour and carrying staffs with a
large knob at one end. They are standing on a raised circular ring,
decorated with oriental characters) <br>
RIKER: I remember my early lessons. <br>
KYLE: You could never get used to the sightless factor, or to losing. <br>
RIKER: True, but I've had fifteen years to practise. <br>
KYLE: Well, let's see if you've learned anything. <br>
(They lower their opaque visors) <br>
BOTH: Onegaishimasu. <br>
(They circle, the small ends of the staves making a noise when they
come close. Riker takes the first swings with the padded end, then
Kyle. Then they return to trying to locate each other by the noise.
Riker hits Kyle on the back, disarms him and sends him flying out of
the ring) <br>
KYLE: Well, you've been practising. <br>
RIKER: And remembering. You should have been the one to die, not her.
Yoroshiku-onegaishimasu. <br>
KYLE: Good. Get it all out. Yoroshiku-onegaishimasu. <br>

by holding his staff over his head) <br>
RIKER: Matta! (Kyle backs away) I had you. <br>
KYLE: Listen, Will. You were too young to understand and I was too hurt
to explain. <br>
RIKER: You were never too hurt for anything. <br>
KYLE: She was your mother, but she was my wife. And when she died all
that kept me going was you. <br>
RIKER: You had a strange way of showing it. <br>

right. Maybe I am no father, and you're no son.

RIKER: Hachidan kiritsu! It's illegal. <br>
KYLE: You're kidding? <br>
RIKER: All those years. That's why I never won. You were cheating. <br>
KYLE: It worked, didn't it? Kept you coming back for more. <br>
RIKER: Incredible. You cheated me. How'd you get away with it? <br>
KYLE: You were just a kid. By the time you were twelve years old, I
knew I couldn't take you but I had to keep you interested, I had to
keep you challenged, didn't I? <br>
RIKER: I always hated you for that. <br>
KYLE: Damn it, Will. You were barely out of diapers when she died. You
hardly knew her! I'd loved her. Of course you carried the pain. So did
I. I should have explained this to you a long time ago, but it hurt too
much. Then the wall grew up between us. And living there, you and me,
the wall got bigger. You know, it's funny. I can talk to a whole
roomful of admirals about anything in the galaxy, but I can't talk to
you about how I feel. <br>
RIKER: How do you feel? <br>
KYLE: How do you think? I love you, son. I've got to get back to the
