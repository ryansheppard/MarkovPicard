CRUSHER: What's that noise? <br>
LAFORGE: They must've left an audio monitoring system on. We're hearing
a few thousand subspace messages. I'll try and shut it off. Got it. <br>
(peace descends, revealing a banging sound) <br>
RIKER: Geordi, what's that? <br>
LAFORGE: I don't know. Sounds like a loose panel or something. I think
it's coming from this service duct over here. <br>
(he pulls a piece of equipment away from the wall to reveal) <br>
RIKER: Here's your loose panel. <br>

LAFORGE: Hey, pooch. hey, pooch, come on out of there. Come on. Come
on. Hey, pooch, what are you doing in there?<br>
WORF: Commander, the shuttlecraft is gone. There is no one on board. <br>
CRUSHER: Commander? <br>
RIKER: What is it? <br>
CRUSHER: Cellular residue. I believe these are the remains of one of
our lieutenants. <br>
(Worf is cutting the deck plate out with his phaser) <br>
CRUSHER: All of the blood traces I found match those of Lieutenant
Aquiel Uhnari. I'll assume those are her remains but I'll need to take
the
deck plate back to Sickbay just to be sure. <br>
RIKER: It would take a powerful weapon to do that. <br>
CRUSHER: I'll have a better idea once I've analysed the deck plate. <br>
RIKER: If that is Uhnari, where's Rocha? <br>
CRUSHER: The station's shuttle's gone. Maybe he took it. <br>
RIKER: Before Uhnari died or after? <br>
WORF: We're ready, Commander. <br>
RIKER: Did you have any luck downloading the station logs? <br>
LAFORGE: Not yet. I can't get past these security lock-outs, and I
think I know why. All encrypted subspace messages are sent through this
channel. Take a look at this signal notation. <br>
RIKER: It's out of sequence. <br>
LAFORGE: Looks like somebody tried to by pass the access protocols and
break into the coded messages. It caused the security lockouts to
freeze right up. <br>
RIKER: Are there any messages missing? <br>
LAFORGE: I won't know until I get into the files. <br>
RIKER: Looks like you've made a friend. <br>

AQUIEL [OC]: Station log, stardate 46458.3. Today we configured the
relay controller grid. It was the last primary system we had to
overhaul. We are scheduled to recalibrate and align the antennae
systems in the next three days. <br>
LAFORGE: Computer, access visual output. <br>
AQUIEL [OC]: Sent in my third request for a message delay buffer. Until
it arrives, Lieutenant Rocha and I have rigged a memory module to
compensate. It better work, or about a half million subspace messages
are going to end up drifting through space. Computer, open Uhnari
correspondence file. <br>
LAFORGE: Computer, access correspondence files, Lieutenant Aquiel
Uhnari. <br>
AQUIEL [OC]: Hello, Shiana. Sorry I haven't talked to you in a while
but I've been dealing with the new Lieutenant, Rocha. So far he's been
rude, arrogant and condescending, and he's only been here two days.
This might be a long year. <br>
LAFORGE: Come on, Lieutenant. Stick with me. <br>
AQUIEL [OC]: I had the dream again. Mother's calling out my name. She's
somewhere in the house. I get to the top of the hill all right, but
then the house is slanted. I'm still walking uphill. I can't find her.

CRUSHER: Well this is just a guess, but from the molecular deposition
on the plating I'd say it was a high-level phaser blast. <br>
RIKER: Could it have been a Klingon disruptor? <br>
CRUSHER: Possibly. <br>
RIKER: Geordi's found evidence that the encrypted messages have been
tampered with, and we are close to Klingon space. <br>
PICARD: There hasn't been a Klingon raid against the Federation for
more than seven years. We can't risk a diplomatic incident until we
have more evidence. <br>
CRUSHER: And there's still the question of what happened to Lieutenant
Rocha. <br>
PICARD: Get Rocha's personnel file from Starfleet Command, and ask
Starbase two twelve to help us find that shuttle. <br>

AQUIEL [on monitor]: Hello, Shiana. By the time you get this the
Batarael will be over. This is the first time I haven't been there.
I've been wondering, who's singing the Horath in my place. (sings)
Jomiael hahnalia ma marou nitalia. Rumael tavariel fatra di va Jomiael.
(next letter) I had that dream again. The one where Mother is
screaming. I climb the hill to our house but I can't get to her.
Shiana, this time I ran away. I was so scared I ran back down the hill.
I think I know why I've been having the dreams about danger. It's
because of what's been happening with that Klingon. He's getting more
aggressive all the time. Not just the usual threat. <br>
(Geordi rewinds the message) <br>
AQUIEL [on monitor]: It's because of what's been happening with that
Klingon. He's getting more aggressive all the time. Not just the usual
threat. Morag actually locked his disruptors to the station this time.
I don't think there'll be any trouble. It just brings up those feelings
of panic, of wanting to run, wanting to get away from danger. Shiana, I
couldn't say this to anyone but you, but the panic? It's the same thing
I used to feel whenever Father got angry, when I knew he was going to
punish me. Only now, I'm out here in space, and there's no place to
run.

the encrypted messages. <br>
LAFORGE: Could be. She didn't say. But I do have several more days of

Klingon Empire will not stand for these kinds of lies. <br>
PICARD: Governor Torak, I apologise. I can see that you honestly didn't
know what happened aboard the station. I will just have to take this

TORAK [on viewscreen]: Gowron won't bother with such a minor incident. <br>

of Succession. I'm sure that he will be happy to come here and
investigate this matter. You needn't worry about it any longer. <br>

station in the middle of nowhere with no one for company except an
egomaniac like Keith Rocha. I took a big risk today. I countermanded an
order he gave. I agreed to handle the comm. traffic for Relay Station
one nine four while they shut down for maintenance. Rocha said we
couldn't handle the additional signal load, but I think he's wrong.
When he finds out he'll be furious. It's days like this I wish I was
home. You know what I miss most? Muskan seed punch. Real Muskan seed
punch. You can get it from the replicator, but it's not the same. I'd
give anything for some of the punch Mother used to make with chunks of
the seeds still in it. (noises off) Keith, is that you? Keith?

still looking for Lieutenant Rocha's. Whatever happened to the
encrypted messages had a cascade effect on the whole storage system. I
can't find his files anywhere. I'm running a level three diagnostic
now. <br>
RIKER: Maybe Rocha didn't make the official logs. Uhnari could have
been responsible for them. <br>

drank muskan seed punch. She had a quirky sense of humour. She liked to

(soon after) <br>
AQUIEL: We were running a level two diagnostic of the message buffer,
Nothing special. Rocha had been on edge all morning, but he'd been
irritable ever since he got there, so I didn't think anything of it. We
were halfway through the procedure when suddenly he attacked me. He
grabbed me, threw me against a bulkhead. I yelled at him to stop but he
wouldn't listen. He took me by the throat. I broke free and tried to
get to the weapons locker. I'm not sure what happened next but somehow
I got aboard the shuttle and left. <br>
TORAK: We found her on our side of the border heading toward Sector two
five two zero. She is lucky my patrol ship did not destroy her vessel
on sight. <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant, why didn't you contact Starfleet? Let them know
what happened on board the station? <br>
AQUIEL: I don't know, sir. Maybe I passed out. I'm not even sure how
long I was in the shuttle before the Klingons picked me up. <br>
LAFORGE: Forty six hours. You've been gone forty six hours. <br>
CRUSHER: We presumed you were dead. Your blood stains were found at the
murder scene. <br>
AQUIEL: I must have cut my head when he pushed me against the bulkhead.
<br>
WORF: Then the remains we found must be those of Lieutenant Rocha. <br>
CRUSHER: I can't confirm that. Until we're able to separate the
cellular residue from the
deck plate, I won't be able to do a clear DNA scan. <br>

a possibility
that you did? <br>
AQUIEL: No, I didn't. <br>
RIKER: You're sure? <br>
AQUIEL: I don't remember exactly what happened to me after I was
attacked. I'm sorry. It's as if all my memories were drained out of me.
<br>
LAFORGE: Your logs said that a Commander Morag had been harassing you.
Did you let him or any other Klingon aboard the station? <br>
AQUIEL: Absolutely not. <br>
WORF: If that is true, then Morag or some other Klingon must have
boarded the station after she left. We found traces of Klingon DNA on
the station. <br>
TORAK: You still try to blame us. <br>
WORF: Have the courage to admit your mistakes. Or are you a lo'Be Vos? <br>
TORAK: At least I do not wear the uniform of the P'tak! <br>
PICARD: Governor, we are merely exploring all the possibilities.
Lieutenant Uhnari's logs reported that Commander Morag had been
harassing the station. <br>

PICARD: If he was only doing his job, then I'm sure you won't mind if
we spoke with him. <br>

speak to Morag. But my patience has limits. <br>

review your logs and personal correspondence for any possible clues
about what happened. <br>

been murdered. We needed information. <br>

AQUIEL: I'm curious. Now that you've met me, am I what you expected? <br>
LAFORGE: Actually, I'm not sure. The woman I saw in those logs is very
complicated. I think there's more to you than meets the eye,
Lieutenant. <br>
AQUIEL: In what way? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, your relationship with Lieutenant Rocha, for example. He
was only there for five days and yet there was evidence of plenty of
friction. You seemed to delight in doing things that you knew would
upset him. Why take on extra comm. traffic when you knew it was going
to make him angry? <br>
AQUIEL: Is that a personal question or part of a murder investigation? <br>
LAFORGE: I don't know. Maybe both. <br>
AQUIEL: Keith Rocha was obnoxious from the minute he reported to duty.
He treated me as though I was beneath contempt. I felt like I had to
battle him to hold my own. But I didn't want to see him dead. <br>

RIKER: I checked into her record, too. Her last posting was on Deriben
Five. I spoke to her commanding officer there. He said she was
argumentative, quick to take offence. He also told me he transferred
her to that relay station because she was hampering their efforts. To
be honest, I'm having trouble believing her story, sir. <br>

LAFORGE: Computer, what happened to the log entries for stardate 46459?
<br>

RIKER: We found your DNA on the bulkheads and the console. We know you
were there. <br>
TORAK: Answer their questions. <br>
MORAG: Yes. Yes, I was there. My patrol route takes me near the station
every six days. Three days ago, I hailed them. There was no response. I
was concerned. <br>
TROI: Concerned? <br>
MORAG: Yes. I went aboard to see what had happened. There was no one
was there, so I left. <br>
RIKER: Is that all? <br>
MORAG: That's all. <br>
DATA: Commander Morag, we have discovered that the encrypted message
bank on the station has been tampered with. Our analysis indicates that
twenty seven priority Starfleet messages are missing. <br>
MORAG: What of it? <br>
DATA: Your DNA was also found on the message control module. <br>
MORAG: This is outrageous! We will not tolerate these ridiculous
accusations! <br>
TORAK: This is a diplomatic matter, Morag! Do not make me search your
ship. <br>
MORAG: Yes, I did take the messages. <br>
PICARD: Did you kill Lieutenant Rocha? <br>
MORAG: No. I killed no one. There was no one there. I took the codes,
but I killed no one. <br>
PICARD: Governor, we would like Commander Morag to remain on board the
Enterprise until this investigation is complete. <br>
TORAK: Take him. <br>
WORF: This way.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: Last night, after I dropped you off at
your quarters you established a subspace link with this console.
You deleted some of Rocha's personal files, didn't you? <br>
AQUIEL: Yes, I did. <br>
LAFORGE: Why? <br>
AQUIEL: I found a letter Rocha was planning to send to Starfleet
Command about me. The letter said I had become belligerent and
insubordinate. He was going to ask for a formal hearing. Geordi, I know
how this looks. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, it looks bad. I find out that you've erased a letter
that contained a possible motivation for murder? <br>
AQUIEL: I didn't kill him. <br>
LAFORGE: Then explain this. <br>
AQUIEL: I was afraid if they found the letter they'd blame me for the
murder. I'm not a model officer. I realise that. Sometimes I act on
impulse instead of thinking things through. <br>
LAFORGE: Aquiel, this really complicates things. </font></p>

LAFORGE: What are you doing? <br>
AQUIEL: Getting out of here. <br>
LAFORGE: Aquiel, running away isn't going to prove your innocence.
Facing the situation will. <br>
AQUIEL: I'm scared, Geordi. <br>
LAFORGE: Look, we'll get through this. I promise you, okay? <br>
AQUIEL: Then you believe me? <br>
LAFORGE: Yes, I do. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AQUIEL: I haven't been this close to someone in a
long time. I don't want to let go of it. <br>
LAFORGE: Neither do I, but I've got six hundred logs to go through. <br>
AQUIEL: All right, but first there's something I want to share with
you. A way that we can become more intimate. My people are partially
telepathic. We use something called the Canar to help focus our
thoughts. We also use the Canar for a stronger emotional link during
love. <br>
(Aquiel picks up a crystal from her display stand) <br>
LAFORGE: I was wondering what that was for. Do both of us have to be
telepathic for it to work? <br>
AQUIEL: Let's find out. <br>
(they kneel either side of the bed, with the Canar in the middle.
Aquiel reaches for Geordi's visor. He takes her hands and guides them) <br>
LAFORGE: Like this. <br>
(she puts their hands on the Canar) <br>
AQUIEL: Think of me.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: It's an exact reproduction of my hand,
right down to the DNA structure. <br>
PICARD: Doctor, you said that this was formed from the organic matter
found in the
deck plates. <br>
CRUSHER: When I infused the matter with a resonance frequency burst, it
activated its DNA. Then it touched my hand and it began to mimic my
cellular structure. <br>
PICARD: Doctor, what exactly is this? <br>
CRUSHER: This is going to sound very farfetched, but have you ever
heard of a coalescent organism? <br>
PICARD: No. <br>
CRUSHER: They're rare microscopic lifeforms which need to absorb other
organisms in order to survive. Now, that in itself isn't so unusual,
but coalescents become the organisms they've absorbed, right down to
the cellular level. <br>
WORF: Do you think this is what happened with your hand? <br>
CRUSHER: There've been reports that these organisms can exist on a
larger scale. Certainly, what happened to my hand seems to support that
theory. <br>
RIKER: So you think that Rocha was killed by one of these organisms? <br>
CRUSHER: It's possible that something happened to him before he
reported for duty on the relay station. <br>
WORF: I do not understand. <br>
CRUSHER: I've checked the records. Before he was posted to the relay
station, Rocha served on an outpost in the Triona System. That is a
remote sector. Maybe he was absorbed by a coalescent during that
mission. <br>
RIKER: So what boarded the station could have been an organism that
looked and acted like Lieutenant Rocha? <br>
WORF: How often do they have to change bodies? <br>
CRUSHER: The microscopic organisms have a cycle of no more than five to
ten seconds. We can only assume a larger, more complex coalescent would
have a cycle of days, even weeks. <br>
PICARD: Doctor, if what you're saying is true, then Rocha attacked
Lieutenant Uhnari to find a new body. <br>
CRUSHER: Right. <br>
RIKER: That means Uhnari is a coalescent. <br>
WORF: There was one other person on the station. Morag. It is possible
he was the one who was absorbed. <br>
PICARD: Computer, locate Commander Morag and Lieutenant Uhnari. <br>
COMPUTER: Commander Morag is in his quarters. Lieutenant Uhnari is not
aboard the Enterprise. <br>
WORF: Where did she go? <br>
COMPUTER: Lieutenant Uhnari transported to Relay Station forty seven at
eighteen thirty hours. <br>
RIKER: You get Morag. I'm going to the station. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir.

and gets a phaser from a drawer. He fires, then ups the power and fires
again. Eventually the gloop is destroyed)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: Maybe the reason you don't remember
anything that happened after Rocha attacked you is that the coalescing
process had begun. (drinks arrive) Thank you. Remember when you said
you felt like the memories had been drained right out of you? That's
probably exactly what was going on. <br>
AQUIEL: Then maybe I did take the phaser. <br>
LAFORGE: Whatever happened, at least you got away before the process
took hold. <br>
AQUIEL: So he turned on Maura. <br>
LAFORGE: Right. Well, what now? <br>
AQUIEL: I guess I'll be going to Starbase two twelve for re assignment.
<br>
LAFORGE: You know, I had a talk with Chief Pendleton in Communications.
There's an opening for a level two specialist. <br>
AQUIEL: Really? I'm sure the waiting list so long I'd be grey before I
got here. <br>
LAFORGE: I could put in a good word. <br>
AQUIEL: It's an appealing offer, but I think I'd rather get here on my
own merits. Don't be surprised if you see my name on that list. </font>
