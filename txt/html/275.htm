forth by my so potent art. But this rough magic I here abjure, and when
I have required some heavenly music, which even now I do, to work mine

PICARD: Data, I can barely see. <br>
DATA: But sir, I am supposed to be attempting a Neo-Platonic magical
rite. The darkness is appropriate for such a ritual. <br>
PICARD: Yes, but Data, this is a play. The audience has to see you. <br>

torchlight by twenty percent. <br>
PICARD: There, that's much better. Now, do you want to try it again? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. Captain, I am not certain I fully understand this
Prospero character. I would appreciate any insight you might have that
would improve my performance. <br>
PICARD: Well, Data, Shakespeare was witnessing the end of the
Renaissance and the birth of the modern era, and Prospero finds himself
in a world where his powers are no longer needed. So, we see him here
about to perform one final creative act before giving up his art
forever. <br>
DATA: There is certainly a tragic aspect to the character. <br>
PICARD: Yes, but there's a certain expectancy too. A hopefulness about
the future. You see, Shakespeare enjoyed mixing opposites. The past and
the future. Hope and despair. Data, what is this? Is this part of your
programme? <br>
(bright lights are coming towards them, a steam whistle blows) <br>
DATA: No, sir. <br>
PICARD: What is going on? <br>
DATA: It appears to be a steam locomotive. <br>

(Picard has a graze on his cheek) <br>
PICARD: Oh yes, I know. I'll get it seen to, Data. <br>
(Data checks the holodeck controls) <br>
DATA: The train we encountered was from one of Doctor Crusher's
holodeck programs. It was a re-creation of the Orient Express, a train
which travelled from Paris to Istanbul from the late nineteenth century
until. <br>
PICARD: Yes, yes, Data, I know about the Orient Express. But what is it
doing on Prospero's Island? <br>
DATA: There appears to have been a malfunction in the holodeck's
database retrieval
programme. The two programs somehow temporarily linked together. <br>
PICARD: Is it possible that this malfunction will affect the other
holodecks as well? <br>
DATA: It is a possibility. I will need to run a diagnostic to be
certain. <br>
PICARD: Very good, Data. But shut down the other holodecks until you're
finished, just to be on the safe side. <br>

in trains. Are you aware that at its peak, the Orient Express carried
more than ten thousand
people a year? <br>
CRUSHER: It isn't really the train itself that I'm interested in. <br>
PICARD: What then? <br>
CRUSHER: It's the experience. The Orient Express is romantic,
mysterious, an elegant way to see exotic places and meet fascinating
people. Do you know that one time, on one trip, both Sigmund Freud and
Gertrude Stein just happened to be in the same car? They ended up
having dinner together every night. <br>
PICARD: I wonder what they talked about? <br>
CRUSHER: Why don't you take a trip yourself and find out? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Mister La Forge. Picard out. <br>
(later at the science station) <br>
PICARD: Have you found anything yet? <br>
LAFORGE: Only that we seem to have more than one mystery here. We still
don't know why the ship jumped into warp, but it looks like we're lucky
it did. There was a theta flux distortion building up around the ship. <br>
PICARD: Why didn't our sensors alert us? <br>
LAFORGE: Our sensors were never designed to detect theta flux
distortions. And yet there is a record of the distortion in the sensor
log. That's the other mystery. <br>
DATA: One fact is clear, however. The distortion was growing in
strength. If we had remained at our original position one point seven
seconds longer, the distortion would have ruptured our warp core. <br>
LAFORGE: If the Enterprise hadn't jumped into warp when it did, we
would've been blown to pieces.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Jefferies tube]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: I just don't get it, Data. What would
cause the engines to suddenly jump into warp? <br>
DATA: Perhaps the engines were activated by a random power fluctuation.
<br>
LAFORGE: Which occurred just in time to save the ship? <br>
DATA: It is improbable, but it is possible. <br>
LAFORGE: I don't know. I don't think I'm ready to start believing in
luck. <br>
(they stop by an access panel) <br>
DATA: There is another possibility. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, what's that. <br>
DATA: The sensors apparently detected a dangerous anomaly that
threatened the Enterprise. It is possible that they triggered a safety
device which caused the ship to avoid destruction. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, but there's no direct link between the warp engines and
the sensors. <br>
(they open the panel) <br>
LAFORGE: Whoa. What is that? It's some kind of new circuit node and
it's connected to at least half a dozen points in the sensor array. <br>
DATA: It appears to be connected to several other systems as well,
including the warp control circuits. <br>
LAFORGE: I guess there's a connection between the warp engines and the
sensors after all. <br>
(a forcefield blocks access to the node) <br>
LAFORGE: A force field. Where did that come from? <br>
DATA: I am not certain. Perhaps it came from the node itself. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, wherever it came from, it sure doesn't want us messing
with this node. <br>
DATA: It appears to be protecting itself.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: We found these nodes in several systems
around the ship. At some level or another, they're all connected. <br>
DATA: These nodes were linking the sensors to our warp control and
defensive systems. We believe this is why the ship jumped to warp. <br>
LAFORGE: When the sensors detected danger, the defensive systems
reacted to the threat and activated the warp engines to protect us. <br>
RIKER: Where did these nodes come from? <br>
DATA: It is possible that the magnascopic storm we recently experienced
had an unexpected effect on the ship's systems. <br>
LAFORGE: Wherever they come from, they seem to be multiplying. <br>
DATA: As they increase, it will become progressively more difficult to
control the ship. <br>
RIKER: What do you propose we do? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, getting rid of them isn't going to be so easy. When we
attempted to examine the circuitry of one of the nodes, it generated a
force field to keep us out. <br>
RIKER: Whatever's going on. our first priority is getting back control
of the ship. <br>
DATA: Agreed. All of the nodal connections intersect in holodeck three.
It appears to be a focal point of some kind. <br>
LAFORGE: We might be able to find a way to use the holodeck circuitry
to disable the nodes permanently. <br>
RIKER: All right. Let's do it.

DATA: Commander. According to my tricorder, the holodeck safeties have

RIKER: All right, let's get out of here.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: The number of systems now being affected by
the nodes has increased considerably. Sensors, engines, replicators,
propulsion, they are all working together now, almost independently of
the main computer. And the nodes link them all through the holodeck. <br>
RIKER: But why the holodeck? It doesn't make any sense. <br>
DATA: Commander, I believe what happens on the holodeck has a direct
effect on the ship. When we attempted to destroy the nodes, the
characters on the train responded almost immediately to stop us. <br>
RIKER: And when the engineer tried to protect us, one of the characters
shot him. <br>
DATA: Then the conductor then signalled for the train to change
directions, and at approximately the same time <br>
LAFORGE: The Enterprise also took off in a new direction. <br>
RIKER: Are you saying the ship is under the control of the holodeck? <br>
DATA: Not precisely. Geordi, does the configuration of connection nodes
look familiar to you? <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah. Yeah, it looks a little like the structure of your
positronic brain. <br>
DATA: That is correct. It would appear that the nodes are in the
process of creating a rudimentary neural net. <br>
RIKER: Data, what are you suggesting? <br>
DATA: Unlikely as it may sound, I believe that the Enterprise may be
forming an intelligence.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Observation lounge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: This is a synaptic map of the human
neo-cortex. This is a cross section of my positronic net. And this is a
schematic of the connection nodes linking the ship's systems. I believe
some sort of neural matrix is forming on the ship. It is still
relatively primitive, but it is an intelligence nonetheless. <br>
TROI: How could that happen? <br>
DATA: I believe it is an emergent property. <br>
PICARD: Explain. <br>
DATA: Complex systems can sometimes behave in ways that are entirely
unpredictable. The human brain, for example, might be described in
terms of cellular functions and neurochemical interactions. But that
description does not explain human consciousness, a capacity that far
exceeds simple neural functions. Consciousness is an emergent property.
<br>
LAFORGE: In other words, something that's more than just the sum of its
parts. <br>
DATA: Exactly. <br>
CRUSHER: How does that explain what's happening to the Enterprise? <br>
DATA: The Enterprise contains a vast database of information which is
managed by a sophisticated computer. This complex system gives the ship
many of the characteristics of a biological organism. <br>
RIKER: That's true. It sees with its sensors, it talks with its
communications systems. <br>
CRUSHER: In a sense, it almost reproduces with the replicators. <br>
PICARD: And you think that the ship has somehow gone beyond those
functions and is developing a new capacity? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. I believe a self-determining intelligence is emerging. <br>
WORF: If that is so, what does the ship want? Where is it taking us? <br>
DATA: I believe the key to understanding the ship's behaviour lies in
the holodeck. All of the connection nodes intersect at that location.
It is clearly some kind of processing centre. <br>
PICARD: Processing centre? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. A focal point where all the ideas and instincts of this
emerging intelligence are first expressed in some form. <br>
TROI: Almost like an imagination. Captain, I'd like to go to the
holodeck. I could interact with the characters and maybe find some
clues to help us understand what's happening. <br>
PICARD: Very well. Mister Data, Mister Worf, I want you to go along.
See if you can to re-establish control of the ship without damaging the
nodes. If the ship is truly an emerging intelligence, then we have a
responsibility to treat it with the same respect as any other being.

TROI: The ship was protecting itself again. Stopping us from
interfering. Whatever it's doing it intends to continue. <br>
LAFORGE: I'm betting it all has something to do with that object that's
forming in the cargo bay. <br>
TROI: I think he's right, Captain. Look at the common themes playing
out on the holodeck. A puzzle being put together, a foundation being
laid, a paper doll being fashioned. They're all images of something
being constructed. <br>
LAFORGE: And some kind of object in the cargo bay that's being
constructed atom by atom. <br>
PICARD: What is that object? <br>
LAFORGE: I have no idea. It's composed of silica polymers, duranium,
and a couple of other compounds we
haven't been able to identify yet.
But creating it has had quite an effect on our systems. Warp power has
dropped forty seven percent. <br>
PICARD: Counsellor, did you draw any other conclusions from your
experiences on the holodeck? Anything that would help us to understand
this situation? <br>
TROI: The holodeck was full of metaphoric imagery like it was having
some kind of daydream. It may not make literal sense, but symbolically
it probably does have some kind of logic to it. <br>
CRUSHER: The characters you spoke to, do they have any significance? <br>
TROI: I think they represent different aspects of the ship. The
Engineer, for instance, may represent the navigational system, the
gunslinger could be the weapon system. <br>
PICARD: Is there any way that we can persuade them to give back control
of the ship? <br>
TROI: I don't think it's possible to reason with them. Many of them are
genuinely unaware of what's going on. It's as though this emergent
intelligence is like an infant acting on impulse, trying to figure
itself out as it goes. The only source of experience it can draw on is
ours through our holodeck programs. <br>
PICARD: Is there a way that we can relate to them on their own level,
find some way to influence their behaviour? <br>
TROI: Maybe there is. I'd like to go back and try. <br>
LAFORGE: Counsellor, we haven't been able to re-establish the safeties.
<br>
CRUSHER: The injuries you suffered on the holodeck weren't severe, but
next time they might kill you. <br>
TROI: I'm aware of that. <br>
PICARD: Very well, Counsellor, go ahead. But bear in mind that whenever
we have tried to hinder their efforts, we've failed. Perhaps it's time
to cooperate with them.

control and most systems are offline. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain, you'd better take a look at this. When the particle
beam cut off, the object was beginning to form a coherent energy
matrix. Now, if these readings are accurate, I'd say that the emission
patterns were almost organic. <br>
PICARD: Are you suggesting that the Enterprise is trying to create a

system is over twelve hours from here. <br>
PICARD: Will the object in the cargo bay survive that long? <br>
LAFORGE: Yes, sir, but that's not the problem. The ship has diverted
all of our systems to maximum propulsion, including life support. We
have less than two hours of reserve oxygen. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, we have to stop the Enterprise. That means you
have to get control of the train. <br>

the Cordannas system is the closest source. Is there any possibility of

Nebula, which is a supernova remnant, and Dikon Alpha, which is a class
nine pulsar. They're both fairly close to our current flight path and
either one could produce vertion particles if we detonated a modified
photon torpedo inside it. <br>
RIKER: Vertions usually occur in miniscule amounts. Do you think either
of these phenomena could produce enough of them? <br>

create them at all. <br>
