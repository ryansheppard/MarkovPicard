WORF: Yes, sir. Romulan. <br>
RIKER: What the hell are they doing in a Federation sector? <br>
LAFORGE: Picking up traces of ultritium residue. An explosive device
must've been used to destroy the craft after it crashed. <br>

anything down there. <br>

nothing there to salvage unless you want to use tweezers. <br>
PICARD: No sign of others? <br>
RIKER: You couldn't see two metres in front of yourself down there. <br>
PICARD: It certainly is the last place one would expect Romulan

would provide ideal cover for an opening move of a new offensive. <br>

CRUSHER: We thought it would be like working on Vulcans, but there are
subtle differences. Too many of them. <br>
PICARD: Can you treat him? <br>
CRUSHER: He has cell damage to vital areas. He's going to need a
transfusion of compatible ribosomes in order to recover.
I'm setting up a schedule to test every member of the crew. <br>
PICARD: We can't use the replicator? <br>
CRUSHER: The molecules are too complex. <br>
RIKER: Will he survive? <br>
CRUSHER: I can't answer that yet. <br>
RIKER: Well let me put it another way. Will he survive long enough to
tell us what he was doing here? <br>
PICARD: Doctor, it's an important consideration. <br>
CRUSHER: I can bring him around for a few minutes. But there is one
serious complication. His brainwaves indicate early neural-pathway
degeneration. <br>
RIKER: Head injury? <br>
CRUSHER: There's no obvious cranial trauma. I'm guessing his exposure
to the magnetic fields on the surface was slowly breaking down his
synaptic connections. <br>
RIKER: Will it affect Geordi the same way? <br>
(She nods, then injects the Romulan) <br>
CRUSHER: He'll be conscious for a minute or two. <br>
RIKER: You are on board the Federation Starship Enterprise. We're
treating your injuries. How long were you down on Galorndon Core? Do
you understand me? <br>
PATAHK: I will not answer questions. <br>
RIKER: We need to know if there are other survivors on the surface. <br>
PATAHK: I am alone. I will not answer any questions. <br>
RIKER: Do you have a mother ship who should be advised of your
condition? <br>
(He passes out again)&nbsp;<br>
PICARD: The only answer he wants to give is that he was alone. <br>
RIKER: Which suggests that he wasn't.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Something, anything to can cut through the
storm. Some way to get a signal through to him. <br>
WESLEY: A neutrino pulse. We could build a portable neutrino source and
send it in a probe to the planet surface. It'll act like a beacon. <br>
DATA: A neutrino pulse would send non-charged particles back up through
the atmosphere and would be detectable by Geordi's Visor. <br>
WESLEY: He can show us that he's found it by modifying the pulse <br>
PICARD: Make it so. <br>
DATA: Captain, I have a new transmission on a parallel frequency to the
distress call. <br>
PICARD: From the surface? <br>

the transmission. <br>
PICARD: On screen. <br>

5) <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: Tomalak to Pi. We have received your distress
signal. Respond. If you can hear me, we are entering the Neutral Zone
now. We will reach you in six hours. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, hail the Romulan vessel. <br>
WORF: Hailing frequencies open, sir. <br>
PICARD: Romulan vessel, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
Federation Starship Enterprise. <br>
WORF: The frequency is open, sir. <br>
PICARD: Commander Tomalak, we have intercepted your transmission. You
are not to enter Federation space. <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: Captain Picard, my apologies. Had I known you
were in this sector, I certainly would have advised you before crossing
the Neutral Zone. <br>
PICARD: Indeed? <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: I'm sure you will understand when I explain.
One of our ships had a slight navigational error and apparently crashed
on Galorndon Core. <br>
PICARD: A slight navigational error? Nearly half a light year past the
Neutral Zone? <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: I assure you, Captain, no aggression was
intended. <br>
PICARD: Commander, we have recovered one of your survivors. <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: He is on board your ship? <br>
PICARD: He is being treated for severe injuries. <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: And his craft? <br>
PICARD: Destroyed, deliberately, after the crash. <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: I'm sure you are prepared to leave at once and
rendezvous with me in the Neutral Zone. <br>
PICARD: I have an away team on the planet. We are waiting for a window
in the storm to beam them up. <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: And then you will return my officer? <br>
PICARD: Are there any other Romulans we should be looking to recover
from Galorndon Core? <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: No. It was a one-man craft. Captain, we will
be at the Federation border of the Neutral Zone in roughly five hours.
We will expect you to rendezvous at that time. <br>
(transmission ends) <br>
PICARD: Counsellor? <br>
TROI: There's great hostility behind his smile. He'll stop at nothing
to complete his mission. <br>
RIKER: Including the Neutral Zone border. <br>
WORF: Captain, I see no reason to return the Romulan to his ship. He
should be held and interrogated. <br>
RIKER: We have every right to detain him, sir. <br>
PICARD: Without evidence of intent, Number One, it will not be a simple
matter. <br>
RIKER: It obviously wasn't pilot's error. I think it demands a response
from us. <br>
PICARD: But we must measure our response carefully, or history may
remember Galorndon Core along with Pearl Harbour and Station Salem One
as the stage for a bloody preamble to war.

It is in Federation space and heading toward us. <br>
PICARD: Belay that order, Number One. Red alert.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: Make sure the scanner select limiter
matches the Visor output range. <br>
BOCHRA: Not so fast. <br>
LAFORGE: Now, place the neural output pods in contact with the
tricorder scanner heads. <br>
BOCHRA: Ready. <br>
LAFORGE: Let her rip. <br>
BOCHRA: Bearing three five zero. <br>
LAFORGE: We did it! The first Federation-Romulan co-venture. <br>
BOCHRA: The storm may be breaking. <br>
LAFORGE: With any luck, there'll be an electromagnetic window opening
up and we can get out of here. <br>
BOCHRA: At which point, I'll be your prisoner. <br>
LAFORGE: Can you walk? <br>
BOCHRA: I don't know. <br>
LAFORGE: Let's find out. Come on. (he hauls Bochra up) Okay, let's go. <br>
BOCHRA: Straight ahead. <br>
LAFORGE: Okay. <br>
BOCHRA: To the right. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Come. <br>
WORF: You wished to see me, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant. I assume you know what it's about. <br>
WORF: Yes. <br>
PICARD: The Romulan ship will reach us within the hour. If our patient
dies it may be just the excuse the Romulan commander needs to start an
incident. The death of a Romulan officer at the hands of the
Federation. Think of it. <br>
WORF: I have, Captain. <br>
PICARD: So, there is no question that the Romulan officer is more
valuable to us alive than dead. <br>
WORF: I understand. <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant, sometimes the moral obligations of command are less
than clear. I have to weigh the good of the many against the needs of
the individual, and try to balance them as realistically as possible.
God knows, I don't always succeed. <br>
WORF: I have not had cause to complain, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Oh, Lieutenant, you wouldn't complain even if you had cause. <br>
WORF: If you order me to agree to the transfusion, I will obey, of
course. <br>
PICARD: I don't want to order you. But I ask you. I beg you to
volunteer. <br>
WORF: I cannot. <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant. <br>
WORF: Sir? <br>
PICARD: That will be all. <br>
(Worf leaves) <br>
PICARD: Picard to Doctor Crusher. <br>
CRUSHER [OC]: Go ahead. <br>
PICARD: Do not continue to enlist the cooperation of Lieutenant Worf. <br>
CRUSHER [OC]: I won't have to, Captain. The Romulan has died.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOCHRA: We've found it! <br>
LAFORGE: Now we have to alter its signal pattern so the Enterprise
knows we've found it. <br>
BOCHRA: Will that be difficult? <br>
LAFORGE: No, not with your help.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Scanners are showing a window, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Expected duration? <br>
DATA: Nine minutes, forty seconds, sir. <br>
WESLEY: No change in the neutrino beacon signal, sir. <br>
WORF: Romulan ship approaching. Bearing three fifty four mark two eight
seven. <br>
PICARD: On screen. <br>
WORF: Entering phaser range. We are being hailed, sir. <br>
PICARD: On viewer. <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: You have one chance to escape destruction,
Picard. Return my officer at once. <br>
PICARD: Commander, you have entered Federation space despite my
warning. <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: You forced the situation. I will not leave
without him. <br>
PICARD: He's dead. <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: Then he is but the first to fall, Picard. <br>
(Transmission ends) <br>
WORF: The Romulan ship is routing power to its forward disruptor array.
<br>
PICARD: All shields to maximum. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Lock phasers on target. <br>
WORF: Phasers locked and ready. <br>
WESLEY: Captain, the signal pattern from the neutrino beacon is
modulating. <br>
TROI: It's Geordi. <br>
RIKER: We can't transport him with the shields up. <br>
WORF: If we lower our shields, the Romulan will strike. <br>
DATA: The electromagnetic window on the planet is closing, sir. Three
minutes remain. <br>
PICARD: Transporter room, lock onto the neutrino beam and stand by. <br>
O'BRIEN [OC]: Standing by, Captain. <br>
DATA: The window is allowing intermittent sensor readings. There are
still numerous ghost images, but I believe we are picking up two life
forms near the beacon. <br>
RIKER: Another Romulan? <br>
DATA: I cannot say. The electromagnetic interference prevents an
accurate reading. <br>
PICARD: But it's a likely hypothesis, Number One. If Commander La Forge
has located a second survivor. Lieutenant, hail the Romulan vessel. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. They're ignoring our hail, sir. <br>
PICARD: Repeat the hail all channels. You see, they have no way of
knowing how accurate our sensors are. Put on your best poker face,
Number One. Open a frequency. Commander Tomalak. It would appear our
away team has rescued a second man from your one man ship. We're
preparing to beam them to the Enterprise. After which, of course, we
will return the survivor to you. <br>
WORF: No acknowledgement, sir. <br>
PICARD: Commander, both our ships are ready to fight. We have two
extremely powerful and destructive arsenals at our command. Our next
actions will have serious repercussions. We have good reason to
mistrust one another, but we have better reasons to set our differences
aside. Now, of course, the question is, who will take the initiative?
Who will make the first gesture of trust? The answer is, I will. I must
lower our shields to beam these men up from the planet surface. Once
the shields are down, you will of course have the opportunity to fire
on us. If you do, you will destroy not only the Enterprise and its
crew, but the cease-fire that the Romulans and the Federation now
enjoy. Lieutenant, lower the shields. Leave the hailing frequency open.
<br>
WORF: Yes, sir. Shields down. <br>
PICARD: Mister O'Brien, transport Mister La Forge and the Romulan
directly to the Bridge. <br>
O'BRIEN [OC]: Aye, sir. Energising. <br>
(Geordi and Bochra appear in front of the viewscreen) <br>
WORF: Security team to the Bridge. <br>
PICARD: Belay that order, Lieutenant. Shields up. No one is going to
harm you. <br>
LAFORGE: You have my word on that. <br>
PICARD: Well, Commander? <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: If he has been in any way mistreated. <br>
BOCHRA: I have given them no information, Commander, but I have not
been mistreated. In fact, this human saved my life. <br>
PICARD: Tomalak, how is it possible you didn't know of the second
Romulan on Galorndon Core? <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: A simple misunderstanding, Captain Picard. I
was obviously misinformed as to the size of the craft. I assure you I
intended no deception. <br>
PICARD: Of course not. <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: You doubt my good faith? <br>
PICARD: Let's just say my faith would be strengthened by a gesture from
you, such as powering down your disruptors. <br>
WORF: Disruptors powering down. <br>
PICARD: Thank you. Cancel Red alert, Lieutenant. Commander, we shall
return your officer and escort your ship to the Neutral Zone. <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: That is acceptable. <br>
(Transmission ends) <br>
PICARD: Good to have you back, Commander. <br>
LAFORGE: Good to be back, sir. Actually, I have Centurion Bochra to
thank for it. <br>
PICARD: Indeed. Commander La Forge and Lieutenant Worf, escort our
guest to transporter room one. <br>
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. Come on. <br>
RIKER: Close call. <br>
PICARD: Too close, Number One. Brinksmanship is a dangerous game. </font>
